Major
=====

.. todo:: Check over the bib output.

.. todo:: Check order of all the manually numbered figures.

.. todo:: Write a conclusion.

.. todo:: font size is screwed up in sysid chapter due to my manually trying to
   resize tables. Fix the font size of the two big tables and the big A matrix.

.. todo:: Get Tustin citation

.. todo:: The References page doesn't need to show up in the pdf.

Minor
=====

.. todo:: sphinxcontrib-bibtex is not resovling hyper links in the pdf in the
   same way the footnotes do. I think this only affects the citations,
   footnotes, and todo items in the autobuilt area.

.. todo:: The footnotes in the latexpdf hyperlink to page i. These don't really
   need to be hyperlinks at all.

.. todo:: The latex build wants the target directive in images to point to
   something different than the html.

.. todo:: See if it possible to center tables in html.
