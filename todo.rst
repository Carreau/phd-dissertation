=====

.. todo:: Write a conclusion.

.. todo:: Try to say more about tables 13.4 5 and 6

.. todo:: sphinxcontrib-bibtex is not resovling hyper links in the pdf in the
   same way the footnotes do. I think this only affects the citations,

   need to be hyperlinks at all.

   something different than the html.

   of the full system.

.. todo:: src/extensions/arms/plot_eig.py seems to no longer exist
   anywhere...rewrite?

.. todo:: Forumlas for the gains and a plot of eigenvalue of forward speed with
   repect to those formulas for the closed loop system. Make sure you no where the L-P
   model numbers are. Maybe make them explicit again in this section.

.. todo:: Plot of gains versus speed (theorectical) for the L-P model instead
   of the whipple model.
