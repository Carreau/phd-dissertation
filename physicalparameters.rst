Physical Parameters

Preface
=======

I was first concerned with the physical parameters of the bicycle and rider in
my multibody dynamics class project where I developed a method of estimating
the parameters from geometry and mass :ref:`Moore2006` which was subsenquently
presented at ISEA 2008 :ref:`Moore2008`. This method served me well until we
needed to have more accurate estimates for the first instrumented bicycle built
at TU Delft. I agreed to measure the bike's physical parameters using the
equipment and procedures developed in :ref:`Kooijman2006` and use the more
accurate bicycle measurements with my basic human model, :ref:`Moore2008`.
These first measurements and the details of the human model are documented in
:ref:`Moore2009a`.  After this, Dr. Hubbard encouraged me to think about the
accuracy of the measurements in more detail, as some of the practices we were
using were lacking. With that in mind and the fact that there was very little
complete data available on the physical parameters of real bicycles, I decided
to measure an assortment of bicycles we had available around the lab in Delft
:ref:`Moore2010`. Once I was back in Davis, we setup almost identical equipment
to measure the two new bicycles we were constructing. Danique Fintelman helped
us come up with a more accurate geometry measurement. Steven Yen measured a
children's bicycle with a gyro wheel. We also improved the human estimates when
Chris Dembia implemented Yeadon's human inertia model and we combined it with
the accurate bicycle measurements. These final methods are implemented in two
open source software packages.

Bicycle Parameters
==================

Accurate measurements of a bicycle's physical parameters are required for
realistic dynamic simulation and analysis. The most basic models require the
geometry, mass, mass location and mass distributions for the rigid bodies. More
complex models require estimates of tire characteristics, human
characteristics, friction, stiffness, damping, etc. In this chapter I present
the measurement of the minimal bicycle/rider parameters required for the
benchmark Whipple bicycle model presented in :ref:`Meijaard2007`. This model is
composed of four rigid bodies, has ideal rolling and frictionless joints, and
is laterally symmetric. A set of 25 parameters describes the geometry, mass,
mass location and mass distribution of each of the rigid bodies. The
experimental methods used to estimate the parameters described herein are based
primarily on the work done in :ref:`Kooijman2006`, :ref:`Kooijman2008` and
:ref:`Moore2009a` but have been refined for improved accuracy and methodology.

Koojiman's work was preceded by several others. DÃ¶hring :ref:`Dohring1953` and
Singh and Goel :ref:`Singh1971` measured the physical parameters of scooters.
Roland and Massing :ref:`Roland1971` measured the physical parameters of a
bicycle in much the same way as is presented, including calculations of
uncertainty from the indirect measurement techniques. Patterson
:ref:`Patterson2004` used a swing to measure the inertia of recumbent bicycles
with a rider. :ref:`Connors2009` and :ref:`Stevens2009` used a 3D CAD package
to estimate the parameters. ref:`Escalona2010` measured a bicycle class in
Spain.

Here I document the indirect measurement of ten real bicycles' physical
parameters. We improve upon these methods by both increasing and reporting the
accuracies of the measurements and by measuring the complete moments of inertia
of the laterally symmetric frame and fork needed for analysis of the nonlinear
model. Furthermore, very little data exists on the physical parameters of
different types of bicycles and this work aims to provide a small sample of
bicycles.

We measured the physical characteristics of eleven different bicycles, three of
which were set up in two different configurations. The first six bicycles,
chosen for both variety and convenience, are as follows: *Batavus Browser*, a
Dutch style city bicycle measured with and without instrumentation as described
in :ref:`Kooijman2009a`; *Batavus Stratos Deluxe*, a Dutch style sporty city
bicycle; *Batavus Crescendo Deluxe* a Dutch style city bicycle with a suspended
fork; *Gary Fisher Mountain Bike*, a hardtail mountain bicycle; *Bianchi
Pista*, a modern steel frame track racing bicycle; and *Yellow Bicycle*, a
stripped down aluminum frame road bicycle measured in two configurations, the
second with the fork rotated in the headtube 180 degrees for larger trail. The
last two bicycles were measured in Davis: the instrumented bicycle presented in
chapter :ref:`instrumentedbicycle` and a children's bicycle with a stabilzing
flywheel called the GyroBike.

These eleven different parameter sets can be used with, but are not limited to,
the benchmark bicycle model. The accuracy of all the measurements are
presented. The accuracies are based on error propagation theory with
correlations taken into account.

Parameters
----------

I was primarily concerned with measuring and estimating the 25 parameters
associated with the benchmark Whipple bicycle model which is derived and
described in :ref:`Meijaard2007`. The unforced two degree-of-freedom,
:math:`\mathbf{q} = [\delta \quad \phi]^T` model takes the form:

.. math::
   :label: eqCanonical

   \mathbf{M\ddot{q}}
   +v\mathbf{C}_1\mathbf{\dot{q}}
   +\left[g\mathbf{K}_0
   +v^2\mathbf{K}_2\right]\mathbf{q}
   =0

where the entries of the :math:`\mathbf{M}`, :math:`\mathbf{C}_1`,
:math:`\mathbf{K}_0` and :math:`\mathbf{K}_2` matrices are combinations of 25
bicycle physical parameters that include the geometry, mass, mass location and
mass distribution of the four rigid bodies. The 25 parameters presented in
:ref:`Meijaard2007` are not necessarily a minimum set for the Whipple model, as
shown in :ref:`Sharp2008`, but are useful none-the-less as they represent
intuitively measurable quantities and have become become standard due to the
nature of the benchmark. They are also not parameters used in my derivation in
Chapter :ref:`eom` but can easily be converted, as will be shown. I don't
concern myself with measuring many more parameters that are not needed due to
the assumptions of the Whipple model such as no-slip tires, lateral symmetry,
knife edge wheels, etc.

The 25 parameters can be measured using many techniques. In general, I
attempted to measure the benchmark parameter as directly as possible to improve
the accuracy.

Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~

This section details the conversion from the benchmark parameter set to my
parameter set as defined in Chapter :ref:`eom`. When the bicycle is in the
nominal configuration the parameters can be converted with the following
realtionships. The wheel radii are defined the same, but the remaining geometry
is calculated with:

.. math::

   d_1 = \operatorname{cos}(\lambda) (c + w - r_R * \operatorname{tan}(\lambda))

   d_3 = -\operatorname{cos}(\lambda) (c - r_F \operatorname{tan}(\lambda))

   d_2 = \frac{(r_R + d_1 \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) - r_F + d_3
   \operatorname{sin}(\lambda))}{\operatorname{cos}(\lambda)}

The mass center locations are as follows:

.. math::

   l_1 = (x_B  \operatorname{cos}(\lambda) - z_B  \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) -
   r_R  \operatorname{sin}(\lambda))

   l_2 = (x_B  \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) + z_B  \operatorname{cos}(\lambda) +
   r_R  \operatorname{cos}(\lambda))

   l_4 = ((z_H + r_F)  \operatorname{cos}(\lambda) + (x_H - w)
   \operatorname{sin}(\lambda))

   l_3 = ((x_H - w - l_4  \operatorname{sin}(\lambda)) /
   \operatorname{cos}(\lambda))

The masses are equivalent:

.. math::

   m_c = m_B

   m_d = m_R

   m_e = m_H

   m_f = m_F

The moments of inertia of the wheels are also equivalent:

.. math::

     I_D =
     \begin{bmatrix}
       I_{D11} & 0 & 0\\
       0 & I_{D22} & 0\\
       0 & 0 & I_{D33}
     \end{bmatrix}
     = I_R =
     \begin{bmatrix}
       I_{Rxx} & 0 & 0\\
       0 & I_{Ryy} & 0\\
       0 & 0 & I_{Rzz}
     \end{bmatrix}

     I_F =
     \begin{bmatrix}
       I_{F11} & 0 & 0\\
       0 & I_{F22} & 0\\
       0 & 0 & I_{F33}
     \end{bmatrix}
     = I_F =
     \begin{bmatrix}
       I_{Fxx} & 0 & 0\\
       0 & I_{Fyy} & 0\\
       0 & 0 & I_{Fzz}
     \end{bmatrix}

The moments and products of inertia for the frame and fork require the
direction cosine matrix with respect to rotation through :math:`\lambda`.

.. math::

   R =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     ca & 0. & -sa\\
     0. & 1. & 0.\\
     sa & 0. & ca
   \end{bmatrix}

.. math::
    I_B =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      I_{Bxx} & 0 & I_{Bxz}\\
      0 & I_{Byy} & 0\\
      I_{Bxz} & 0 & I_{Bzz}
    \end{bmatrix}

    I_C =  R I_B R^T

.. math::
    I_H =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      I_{Hxx} & 0 & I_{Hxz}\\
      0 & I_{Hyy} & 0\\
      I_{Hxz} & 0 & I_{Hzz}
    \end{bmatrix}

    I_E =  R I_H R^T


Bicycle Descriptions
--------------------

We measured a total of eight bicycles in eleven configurations.  The three
Batavus bicycles were donated by the manufacturer. We asked for a bicycle that
they considered stable and one that they did not. They offered the Browser as a
"stable" bicycle and the Stratos as "nervous". The Crescendo was considered
average handling. We measured an instrumented version of the Browser that was
used in the experiments described in Chapter :ref:`delftbicycle`. The Fisher
and the Pista were chosen to provide some variety, a mountain and road bike.
The yellow bike is used to demonstrate bicycle stability and the forked is
reversed to provide better stability when perturbed with no rider. The Davis
instrumented bicycle is an instrumented bicycle described in Chapter
:ref:`davisbicycle` and we measured the frame in configurations for different
rider seating positions. The child's bicycle has the GyroWheel product
installed in the front wheel.

ACCURACY
--------

I took more care to improve and report the accuracy of the measurements of
the parameters. Following the footsteps of :ref:`Roland1971` I used error
propagation theory to calculate accuracy of the 25 benchmark parameters. We
start by estimating the standard deviation of the actual measurements taken. If
:math:`x` is a parameter and is a function of the measurements,
:math:`u,v,\ldots`, then :math:`x` is a random variable defined as
:math:`x=f(u,v,\ldots)`. The sample variance of :math:`x` is defined as

.. math::
   :label: sampleVariance

   s_x^2 =
   \frac{1}{N-1}\sum^N_{i=1}
   \left[(u_i - \bar{u})^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)^2 +
   (v_i - \bar{v})^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)^2 +
   2(u_i - \bar{u})(v_i - \bar{v})\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)
   + \ldots\right]

Using the definitions for variance and covariance, Equation
:eq:`sampleVariance` can be simplified to

.. math::
   :label: variance

   s_x^2 = s_u^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)^2 +
           s_v^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)^2 +
           2s_{uv}\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)
           + \ldots

If :math:`u` and :math:`v` are uncorrelated then :math:`s_{uv}=0`. Most of the
calculations hereafter have uncorrelated variables but a few do not and the
covariance has to be taken into account. Equation :eq:`variance` can be used to
calculate the variance of all types of functions. Simple addition of two random
variables may be the most basic example:

.. math::
   :label: addition

   x =  au + bv\\
   s_x = a^2s_u^2 + b^2s_v^2

Geometry
--------

First attempts at measuring the geometry focused on the benchmark parameters:
trail, wheelbase, and steer axis tilt, but I also present an alternative method
for the geometry that attempts to measure the distances in my model derivation
which improves the accuracy of the parameters. I assumed that the frame did not
flex and that the wheel radii do not change with rider weight.

Wheel Radii
~~~~~~~~~~~

The radii of the front :math:`r_\mathrm{F}` and rear :math:`r_\mathrm{R}`
wheels were estimated by measuring the linear distance traversed along the
ground through either 13 or 14 rotations of the wheel. Each traversal was
measured separately and the measurements were taken with rider seated on the
bicycle, except for the gyro bicycle which had no rider (72kg rider for the
Delft bikes and 82kg for the Davis bike...I gained some weight drinking all
that beer in the Netherlands). A 30 meter tape measure (resolution: 2mm) was
pulled tight and taped on a flat level smooth floor. The tire was marked with
chalk and aligned with the tape measure Fig.  :ref:`figTireChalk`. The accuracy
of the distance measurement is approximately :math:`\pm0.01` meter. The tires
were pumped to the recommended inflation pressure before the measurements. The
wheel radius is calculated by

.. math::
    :label: wheelRadius

    r\pm\sigma_r=
    \frac{d}{2\pi n}
    \pm\left(\frac{\sigma_d}{2\pi n}\right)

.. _figTireChalk:

.. figure:: figures/physicalparameters/tireChalk.jpg
   :align: center

   Wheel and tire with chalk mark aligned to the tape measure.

.. _secHeadtube:

Head tube angle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the first six bicycles the head tube angle was measured directly using an
electronic level with a :math:`\pm0.2^{\circ}` accuracy. The bicycle frame was
fixed perpendicular to the ground, the steering angle was set to the nominal,
tire pressures were at recommended levels and the bicycle was unloaded. The
steer axis tilt :math:`\lambda` is the complement to the head tube angle.

.. math::
   :label: eqHeadTubeAngle

   \lambda\pm\sigma_\lambda
   =\frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}(90^{\circ}-\lambda_{ht})
   \pm\left(\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}\right)\sigma_{\lambda_{ht}}

.. _figHeadtube:

.. figure:: figures/physicalparameters/headtube.jpg
   :align: center

Trail
~~~~~

Trail is difficult to measure directly due to the fact that the tire has a
contact patch and there is no distinct point to measure to. I instead chose to
measure the fork offset. The fork offset was measured by clamping the steer
tube of the front fork into a v-block on a flat table. A ruler was used to
measure the height of the center of the head tube and the height of the center
of the axle axis. The fork blades were aligned such that the axle axis was
parallel to the table surface.

.. math::
   :label: eqTrail

   c=\frac{r_\mathrm{F}\sin{\lambda}-f_o}{\cos{\lambda}}

.. math::
   :label: eqTrailVar

   \sigma_{c}^{2}=\sigma_{r_{\mathrm{F}}}^{2}\tan^2{\lambda} -
   \sigma_{f_o}^{2}\sec^2{\lambda} +
   \sigma_{\lambda}^{2}\left(r_\mathrm{F}\sec^2{\lambda} -
   f_o\sec{\lambda}\tan{\lambda}\right)^2

Wheelbase
~~~~~~~~~

We measured the wheelbase with the bicycle in nominal configuration described
in Section :ref:`secHeadtube`. We used a tape measure to measure the distance
from one wheel axle center to the other with a 0.002 m accuracy.

Alternative Geometry Method
---------------------------

Our forumulation of the geometry in the Whipple bicycle model is different that
the :ref:`Meijaard2007` definition. These can almost be measured directly
giving a more accurate estimate. The bicycle frame is set on a granite
measurment table such that the head tube is in in a v-block and parallel to the
table surface and the bicycle frame's rear axle is above the headtube. The is
fork rotated in the headtube such that the fork blades curve upwards. Two dummy
axles are fit into the front and rear dropouts and the axles are ensured to be
parrallel to the table surface. The height from the table surface to the top
of each axle are recorded with a height gage and the diameters of the axles are
measured with a micrometer or caliper. These give direct measurments of the
front and rear offsets, :math:`d_3` and :math:`d_1`. The outer distance between the
two axles are then measured giving :math:`d_4`. :math:`d_2` can be computed
with:

.. math::
   :label: d2

   d_2 = \sqrt{d_4^2 - (d_1 - d_3)^2}


If the :math:`r_F` does not equal :math:`r_R` then the steer axis tilt cannot
be computed analytically as the relation holds:

.. math::
   :label: eqLambda

   \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) = \frac{r_F - r_R + d_2 \operatorname{cos}(\lambda)}{d_1 + d_3}

It is trivial to find the solution numerically. If :math:`r_F=r_R`,
:math:`\lambda` has an analytic solution:

.. math::
   :label: lambdaEqualRadii

   \lambda = \operatorname{arctan}\right(\frac{d_2}{d_1 + d_3}\left)

Wheelbase is:

.. math::
   :label: eqWheelbase

    w = (d_1 + d_3) \operatorname{cos}(\lambda) + d_2 \operatorname{sin}(\lambda)

Trail is then computed with Equation :eq:`eqTrail`, realizing :math:`f_o = d_3`:

.. math::
   :label: eqTrailD3

    c = \frac{r_F \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) - d_3}{\operatorname{cos}(\lambda)}

Mass
----

For the first six bicycles, each of the four bicycle parts were measured using
a Molen 20 kilogram scale with a resolution of 20 grams. The accuracy was
conservatively assumed to also be :math:`\pm20` grams. Also, the total mass was
measured using a spring scale with a resolution of 100 grams. The total mass
was only used for comparison purposes, as it was not very accurate. The mass of
the parts of the Davis Instrumented Bicycle and the Gyro Bicycle were measured
with a digital scale with a resolution of 0.01 kg.

.. todo:: list the details of the scale in Hull's lab

.. _figMassScale:

   The scale used to measure the mass of each bicycle component.

CENTER OF MASS
--------------

WHEELS
~~~~~~

The centers of mass of the wheels were assumed to be at their geometrical
centers to comply with the Whipple model.

REAR FRAME
----------

The rear frame bicycle configuration was hung in at least three orientations
through the lateral mid-plane. I assumed that the frame was laterally
symmetric, complying with the Whipple model, thus reducing the need to use a
more complex three dimensional measurement setup. The frame could rotate about
a joint such that gravity aligned the center of mass with the support rod axis.
The orientation angle of the steer axis, :math:`\alpha_\mathrm{B}`, see Figure
:ref:`figAngles`, relative to the earth was measured using a digital level
(:math:`\pm0.2^{\circ}` accuracy), Figure :ref:`figLevel`. A thin string was
aligned with the pendulum axis and whiched passed by the frame. The horizontal
distance :math:`a_\mathrm{B}` between the rear axle and the string was measured
by aligning a 1 mm resolution ruler perpendicular to the string. The distance
:math:`a_\mathrm{B}` was negative if the string fell to the right of the rear
axle and positive if it fell to the left of the rear axle. These measurements
allow for the calculation of the center of mass location in the global
reference frame.

   bicycle reference frame :math:`XYZ\_B` with the pendulum reference frame

   Exaggerated intersection of the three pendulum axes and the location of the
   center of mass.

.. _figLevel:

.. figure:: figures/physicalparameters/YellowFrameTorsionalThird.jpg

   The digital level was mounted to a straight edge aligned with the headtube of
   the bicycle frame. This was done without allowing the straight edge to touch
   the frame. The frame wasn't completely stationary so this was difficult. The
   light frame oscillations could be damped out by submerging a low hanging area
   of the frame into a bucket of water to decrease the oscillation.

.. _figPendDist:

.. figure:: figures/physicalparameters/pendDist.jpg

   Measuring the distance from the pendulum axis to the rear wheel axle using
   level ruler.

The frame rotation angle :math:`\beta_\mathrm{B}` is defined as rotation of the
frame in the nominal benchmark configuration to the hanging orientation,
rotated about the :math:`Y` axis.

.. math::
   :label: eqFrameRotAng

   \beta=\lambda-\alpha

.. math::
   :label: eqFrameRotAngVar

   \sigma_{\beta}^{2} = \sigma_{\lambda}^{2} + \sigma_{\alpha}^{2}

The center of mass can be found by realizing that the pendulum axis :math:`X_P`
is simply a line in the nominal bicycle reference frame with a slope :math:`m`
and a z-intercept :math:`b` where the :math:`i` subscript corresponds the
different frame orientations, see Figure :ref:`figTriangle`. The slope can be
shown to be:

.. math::
   :label: eqSlope

   m_i=-\tan{\beta_i}

.. math::
   :label: eqSlopeVar

   \sigma_{m}^{2} = \sigma_{\beta}^{2}\sec^{4}{\beta}

The z-intercept can be shown to be

.. math::
   :label: eqZInt

   b_i=-\left(\frac{a_\mathrm{B}}{\cos{\beta_i}}+r_\mathrm{R}\right)

.. math::
   :label: eqZIntvar

   \sigma_{b}^{2} = \sigma_{a}^{2}\sec^{2}{\beta} +
   \sigma_{r_\mathrm{R}}^{2} +
   \sigma_{\beta}^{2}a^{2}\sec^{2}{\beta}\tan^{2}{\beta}

Theoretically, the center of mass lies on each line but due to experimental
error, if there are more than two lines, the lines do not cross all at the same
point. Only two lines are required to calculate the center of mass of the
laterally symmetric frame, but more orientations increase the center of mass
measurement accuracy.  The three lines are defined as:

.. math::
   :label: eqLine

   z = m_ix+b_i

The mass center location can be calculated by finding the intersection of these
three lines. Two approaches were used used to calculate the center of mass.
Intuition leads one to think that the center of mass is located at the centroid
of the triangle made by the three intersecting lines. The centroid can be found
by calculating the intersection point of each pair of lines and then averaging
the three intersection points.

.. math::
   :label: eqLinearSystem

   \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
        -m_1 & 1\\
        -m_2 & 1
    \end{array}
    \right]
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
        x_a\\
        z_a
    \end{array}
    \right]
    =
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
        b_1\\
        b_2
    \end{array}
    \right]

.. math::
   x_\mathrm{B} = \frac{x_a + x_b + x_c}{3}

.. math::
   z_\mathrm{B} = \frac{z_a + z_b + z_c}{3}

Alternatively, the three lines can be treated as an over determined linear
system and the least squares method is used to find a unique solution. This
solution is not the same as the triangle centroid method.

.. math::
   :label: eqLeastSquares

   \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
        -m_1 & 1\\
        -m_2 & 1\\
        -m_3 & 1
    \end{array}
    \right]
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
        x_\mathrm{B}\\
        z_\mathrm{B}
    \end{array}
    \right]
    =
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
        b_1\\
        b_2\\
        b_3
    \end{array}
    \right]

The solution with the higher accuracy is the preferred one.

Fork and Handlebar
------------------

The fork and handlebars are a bit trickier to hang in three
different orientations. Typically two angles can be obtained by
clamping to the steer tube at the top and the bottom. The third
angle can be obtained by clamping to the stem. The center of mass
of the fork is calculated in the same fashion. The slope of the
line in the benchmark reference frame is the same as for the frame
but the z-intercept is different:

.. math::
   :label: eqZIntFork

   b = w\tan{\beta} - r_\mathrm{F} - \frac{a}{\cos{\beta}}

.. math::
   :label: eqZIntForkVar

   \sigma_{b}^{2} = \sigma_{w}^{2}\tan^{2}\beta +
   \sigma_{\beta}^{2}\left(w\sec^{2}\beta -
   a\sec\beta\tan\beta\right)^{2} + \sigma_{r_\mathrm{F}}^{2} +
   \sigma_{a}^{2}\sec^{2}\beta

.. todo:: add details about measuring the handlebar separate in the davis bike

.. _secMoI:

Inertia
=======

The moments of inertia of the wheels, frame and fork were measured by taking
advantage of the assumed symmetry of the parts and by hanging the parts as both
compound and torsional pendulums and measuring their periods of oscillation
when perturbed at small angles. The rate of oscillation was measured using a
`Silicon Sensing CRS03 100 deg/s rate gyro
<http://www.siliconsensing.com/CRS03>`_.  The rate gyro was sampled at 1000hz
with a `National Instruments USB-6008 12 bit data acquisition unit
<http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/14604>`_ and the Matlab data
aquisition toolbox. The measurement durations were between 15 and 30 secs and
each moment of inertia measurement was performed at least three times. No extra care was
taken to calibrate the rate gyro, maintain a constant power source (i.e. the
battery drains slowly), or account for drift. The raw voltage signal was used
to determine only the period of oscillation which is needed for the moment of
inertia calculations.

   Example of the raw voltage data taken during a 30 second
   measurement of the oscillation of one of the components.

The function Eqn eqn:decayOs was fit to the data using a nonlinear
least squares fit routine for each experiment to determine the
quantities :math:`A`, :math:`B`, :math:`C`, :math:`\zeta`,
and :math:`\omega`.

.. math::
   :label: eqnDecayOs

   f(t) = A + e^{-\zeta\omega t}\left[B\sin{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}\omega t} +
   C\cos{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}\omega t}\right]

Most of the data fit the damped oscillation function well with very light (and
ignorable) damping. There were several instances of beating-like phenomena for
some of the parts at particular orientations. Roland and Massing
:ref:`Roland1971` also encountered this problem and used a bearing to prevent
the torsional pendulum from swinging. Figure :ref:`figBeating` shows an example
of the beating like phenomena.

   :label: figBeating
   :align: center

   An example of the beating-like phenomena observed on 5\\% of the
   experiments.

The physical phenomenon observed corresponding to data sets such as these was
that the bicycle frame or fork was perturbed torsionally.  After set into
motion the torsional motion died out and a longitudinal swinging motion
increased. The motions alternated back and forth with neither ever reaching
zero. The frequencies of these motions were very close to one another and it is
not apparent how dissect the two. We explored fitting to a function such as

.. math::
   :label: eqnSumSines

   f(t) = A\sin{(\omega_1 t)} + B\sin{(\omega_2 t + \phi)} + C

But the fit predicts that :math:`\omega_1` and :math:`\omega_2`
are very similar frequencies. There was no easy way to choose which
of the two :math:`\omega`'s was the one associated with the
torsional oscillation. Some work was done to model the torsional
pendulum as a laterally flexible beam to determine this, but we
thought accuracy of the period calculation would not improve enough
for the effort required. Future experiments should simply prevent
the swinging motion of the pendulum without damping the torsional
motion.

The period for a damped oscillation is

.. math::
   :label: eqnPeriodDamped

   T = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}\omega_n}

The uncertainty in the period, :math:`T`, can be determined from
the fit. Firstly, the variance of the fit is

.. math::
   :label: eqnFitVariance

   \sigma_y^2 =
   \frac{1}{N-5}\sum_{i=1}^N(y_{mi}-\bar{y}_m)^2-(y_{pi}-\bar{y}_m)^2

The covariance matrix of the fit function can be formed

.. math::
   :label: eqnCovariance

   \mathbf{U} = \sigma_y^2\mathbf{H}^{-1}

where :math:`\mathbf{H}` is the HessianÂ :ref:`Hubbard1989b`.
:math:`\mathbf{U}` is a :math:`5\times5` matrix with the variances of each of
the five fit parameters along the diagonal.  The variance of :math:`T` can be
computed using the variance of :math:`\zeta` and :math:`\omega`. It is
important to note that the uncertainties in the period are very low
(:math:`<1e-4`), even for the fits with low :math:`r^2` values.

Torsional Pendulum
------------------

A torsional pendulum was used to measure all moments of inertia about axes in
the laterally symmetric plane of each of the wheels, fork and frame. The
pendulum is made up of a rigid mount, an upper clamp, a torsion rod, and
various lower clamps.

.. figure:: ../../../images/fixture.jpg
   :caption: The rigid pendulum fixture mounted to a concrete column.
   :align: center
   :label:figFixture

A 5 mm diameter, 1 m long mild steel rod was used as the torsion spring. A
lightweight, low relative moment of inertia clamp was constructed that could
clamp the rim and the tire. The moments of inertia of the clamps were
neglected. The wheel was hung freely such that the center of mass aligned with
the torsional pendulum axis and then secured. The wheel was then perturbed and
oscillated about the pendulum axis. The rate gyro was mounted on the clamp
oriented along the pendulum axis.

The torsional pendulum was calibrated using a known moment of inertia
Fig.Â fig:rod. A torsional pendulum almost identical to the one used in
:ref:`Kooijman2006` was used to measure the average period
:math:`\overline{T}_i` of oscillation of the rear frame at three different
orientation angles :math:`\beta_i`, where :math:`i=1`, :math:`2`, :math:`3`, as
shown in Fig.Â fig:triangle. The parts were perturbed lightly, less than 1
degree, and allowed to oscillate about the pendulum axis through at least ten
periods. This was done at least three times for each frame and the recorded
periods were averaged.

.. figure:: ../../../images/rod.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt: image
   :caption:The steel calibration rod. The moment of inertia of the rod,
    I=\\frac{m}{12}(3r^2+l^2), can be used to estimate the stiffness of the
    pendulum, k=\\frac{4I\\pi^2}{\\overline{T}^2}, with k=5.62\\pm0.02 \\frac{\\textrm{Nm}}{\\textrm{rad}}
   :label:figRod


WHEELS
------

Finding the full inertia tensors of the wheels is less complex because the
wheels are assumed symmetric about three orthogonal planes so products of
inertia are zero. The :math:`I_{xx}=I_{zz}` moments of inertia were calculated
by measuring the averaged period of oscillation about an axis in the
:math:`XZ`-plane using the torsional pendulum setup and Eq.Â eq:torPend.The
wheels are assumed to be laterally symmetric and about any radial axis. Thus
only two moments of inertia are required for the set of benchmark parameters.
The moment of inertia about the axle was measured by hanging the wheel as a
compound pendulum, Fig.Â fig:wheelIyy. The wheel was hung on a horizontal rod
and perturbed to oscillate about the axis of the rod. This rate gyro was
attached to the spokes near the hub and oriented mostly along the axle axis.
The wheels tended to precess at the contact point about the vertical axis which
added a very low frequency component of rate along the vertical radial axis,
but this should not affect the period estimation about the compound pendulum
axis. A fixture that prevented precession would be preferable for future
measurements. The pendulum arm length is the distance from the rod/rim contact
point to the mass center of the wheel. The inner diameter of the rim was
measured and divided by two to get :math:`l_\mathrm{F,R}`. The moment of
inertia about the axle is calculated from:

.. math::
   :label: eqCompoundInertia

   I_{\mathrm{R}yy} = \left(\frac{\bar{T}}{2\pi}\right)^2m_\mathrm{R}gl_\mathrm{R} -
    m_\mathrm{R}l^2

    }{\\subref{fig:FwheelTor} The front wheel of the Crescendo hung as a
    torsional pendulum. \\subref{fig:wheelIyy} A wheel hung as a compound pendulum.}(fig:wheelPend)


The radial moment of inertia was measured by hanging the wheel as a torsional
pendulum, Fig.Â fig:FwheelTor. The wheel was hung freely such that the center of
mass aligned with the torsional pendulum axis and then secured. The wheel was
then perturbed and oscillated about the vertical pendulum axis. The radial
moment of inertia can can calculated as such:

.. math::
   I_{xx} = \frac{k\bar{T}^2}{4\pi^2}


FRAME
-----

Three measurements were made to estimate the globally referenced moments and
products of inertia (:math:`I_{xx}`, :math:`I_{xz}` and :math:`I_{zz}`) of the
rear frame. The frame was typically hung from the three main tubes: seat tube,
down tube and top tube, Fig.Â fig:level. The rear fender prevented easy
connection to the seat tube on some of the bikes and the clamp was attached to
the fender. The fender was generally less rigid than the frame tube.  For best
accuracy with only three orientation angles, the frame should be hung at three
angles that are :math:`120^\circ` apart.  The three tubes on the frame
generally provide that the orientation angles were spread evenly at about
:math:`120^\circ`. Furthermore, taking data at more orientation angles could
improve the accuracy and is generally possible with standard diamond frame
bicycles.

Three moments of inertia :math:`J_{i}` about the pendulum axes were calculated
using :eq:eqTorPend.

.. math::
   :label:eqTorPend

   J_i=\frac{k\overline{T}_i^2}{4\pi^2}

The moments and products of inertia of the rear frame and handlebar/fork
assembly with reference to the benchmark coordinate system were calculated by
formulating the relationship between inertial frames

.. math::
   :label:eqRotIn

   \mathbf{J}_i=\mathbf{R}_i\mathbf{IR}_i^T

where :math:`\mathbf{J}_i` is the inertia tensor about the
pendulum axes, :math:`\mathbf{I}`, is the inertia tensor in the
global reference frame and :math:`\mathbf{R}` is the rotation
matrix relating the two frames, Fig.Â fig:angles. The global inertia
tensor is defined as

.. math::
   :label:eqMoI

   \mathbf{I}=
    \left[
    \begin{array}{rr}
        I_{xx}  & I_{xz}\\
        I_{xz} & I_{zz}
    \end{array}
    \right]\textrm{.}

The inertia tensor can be reduced to a :math:`2\times2` matrix because the
frame is assumed to be laterally symmetric and the :math:`y` axis of the
pendulum reference is the same as the :math:`y` axis of the benchmark reference
frame. The simple rotation matrix about the :math:`Y`-axis can similarly be
reduced to a :math:`2\times2` matrix where :math:`s_{\beta i}` and
:math:`c_{\beta i}` are defined as :math:`\sin{\beta_i}` and
:math:`\cos{\beta_i}`, respectively.

.. math::
   :label:eqRotMat

   \mathbf{R}=
   \left[
     \begin{array}{rr}
       c_{\beta i} & -s_{\beta i}\\
       s_{\beta i} & c_{\beta i}
     \end{array}
   \right]

The first entry of :math:`\mathbf{J}_i` in Eq.Â eq:rotIn is the moment of
inertia about the pendulum axis and is written explicitly as

.. math::
   :label:eqInRelComp

   J_{i}=c^{2}_{\beta i}I_{xx}-2s_{\beta i}c_{\beta i}I_{xz}+s^{2}_{\beta i}I_{zz}\textrm{.}

Similarly, calculating all three :math:`J_{i}` allows one to form

.. math::
   :label:eqInRel

   \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
        J_{1}\\
        J_{2}\\
        J_{3}
    \end{array}
    \right]
    =
    \left[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
        c_{\beta 1}^2 & -2s_{\beta 1}c_{\beta 1} & s_{\beta 1}^2\\
        c_{\beta 2}^2 & -2s_{\beta 2}c_{\beta 2} & s_{\beta 2}^2\\
        c_{\beta 3}^2 & -2s_{\beta 3}c_{\beta 3} & s_{\beta 3}^2
    \end{array}
    \right]
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
        I_{xx}\\
        I_{xz}\\
        I_{zz}
    \end{array}
    \right]

and the moments of inertia can be solved for. The inertia of the frame about an
axis normal to the plane of symmetry was estimated by hanging the frame as a
compound pendulum at the wheel axis, Fig.:ref:`figFrameCompound`. Equation
:eq:`eqCompoundInertia` is used but with the mass of the frame and the frame
pendulum length.

.. math::
   :label: eqFramePendLength

   l_B=\sqrt{x_B^2+(z_B+r_R)^2}

FORK AND HANDLEBAR
------------------

The inertia of the fork and handlebar is calculated in the same way
as the frame. The fork is hung as both a torsional pendulum,
Fig.fig:StratosFork, and as a compound pendulum,
Fig.fig:forkCompound. The fork provides fewer mounting options to
obtain at least three equally spaced orientation angles, especially
if there is no fender. The torsional calculations follow
equations :eq:`eqTorPend` through :eq:`eqInRel` and the compound pendulum
calculations is calculated with equationeq:CompoundInertia. The
fork pendulum length is calculated using

.. math::
   l_H=\sqrt{(x_H-w)^2+(z_H+r_F)^2}

CONCLUSION
==========

We have presented a detailed method to accurately estimate the physical
parameters of a bicycle needed for the benchmarked Whipple bicycle
modelÂ :ref:`Meijaard2007`. We measured eight different bicycles providing both
the parameter sets and linear model coefficient matrices for the bicycles alone
and the bicycles with the same rigid rider. The uncertainties in the parameters
and matrix coefficients are included for the bicycle alone. Finally, we have
presented a brief comparison of the eight bicycles using eigenanalysis and Bode
frequency response.
