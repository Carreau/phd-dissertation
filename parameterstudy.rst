Parameter Studies
=================

* Variation of parameters and effects to linear stability
* Comparison of the linear properties of real bicycles
* Note that flipping fork around raises the weave speed.
* Parameter studies are suited to a small range because most bicycles are the
  same design.
* Cite Tak and the sensitivty study he did.
* Note that a bicycle without rider has two oscillatory modes as some point and
  explain them.
