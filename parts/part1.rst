During my PhD, I decided to investigate the effect of the actin network on the
mechanical properties of cells. Indeed, cell mechanics are a key parameter that
has crucial impact on cellular and organisms functions. Being able to detect
changes in the mechanical properties and to understand the mechanism that
governs these changes is an important step in the study of cellular behavior as
well as in the differentiation of healthy from cancerous cells and tissue.
Understanding the mechanisms that are at the origin of cell motion and shape
changes, is also a decisive step in controlling cell behavior, with the ultimate
goal to prevent cancer cell invasion and division without impairing healthy
cells.

During the last three years, I decided to focus on biomimetic systems and
to determine the characteristics of actin networks. Actin is a highly conserved
component across the living domain, and it plays a major role in cell
mechanics. By interacting with a number of other components of the cell, actin
is able to form various different types of networks. I decided to focus my research on such networks that were created under 
controlled conditions. 

Along this dissertation, we will mainly focus on three systems.

First, we reconstituted an already observed actin network — the actin
cortex — on a biomimetic system, then showed that a
second sparse actin network, which was previously unseen, emanates from it, and finally characterized its mechanical
properties. We developed the idea that the effect of this second network cannot 
be neglected in cells and investigated a few of the phenomena it may be involved
in.

As the effect of such a sparse actin has not been demonstrated in living cells, we decided to
investigate the effect of another sparse actin network found in a living cells. In
collaboration with the group of Marie Hélène Verlhac at the College de France, we studied the mechanical properties
in the cytosol of mouse oocytes. We saw in this system that actin-related proteins had
hi-impact on the structure and the mechanics of both the cell and the actin
network. 

Characterizing the dynamics of a network in a living cell by controlling the
conditions remains complex.  In a third research stream, we characterized the dynamical changes of tension created by reconstituted actin
cortices, that are linked to a lipid 
membrane. By studying liposome "doublets", we could measure the variation of tension generated by the acto-myosin cortex over
time. This system is composed by a liposome doublet covered with
an actin network. By imaging with Spinning disk microscopy, we could
reconstruct the changes in the acto-myosin network and deduce them in its
properties, from the geometrical variation during the network contraction.

Introduction

Cells are the basic components of living organisms. Understanding their
individual behavior and the way they function is a key step to understand
how they interact with their environment. One of the key components within most
cells is the actin cytoskeleton, which is made up of actin monomers, a highly conserved protein across species, which plays
an important role for cell mechanics, ranging from cell migration to cell differentiation
and division. Hence the crucial role it plays for the mechanical properties of
the cell and its mechanical interaction with the environment. Under the cell membrane lies a 
thin actin network which controls the mechanical properties of the cell: 
the actin cortex. The mechanical behavior of this actin cortex is itself driven
by the dynamics and interactions within the actin network it is made of.
So, understanding this actin network is a key to learn how the actin
cortex behaves, leading to a better understanding of cells and tissue. 

The properties of an actin network highly depend on its structure. The
structure itself depends on many parameters that influence how the network is
formed.  The network structure and formation, influenced both by the physical and
chemical conditions and the spatial and temporal variation of these parameters, such as mechanical 
stress or ion-concentration, can determine the fate of the network. It is 
therefore important to study these networks and their dynamic behavior in order to grasp the
changing structure of the cell.


Cells are complex systems that adapt their shape, mechanical properties and
biochemical conditions permanently. The spatial repartition of these
properties is also variable as the cell regulates the concentration of proteins
all across its cytoplasm. In order to achieve a thorough study of the effect of each component independently,
it is crucial to study actin networks in a controlled environment.

Biomimetic systems allow to respond to most of these concerns. First they provide a
controlled environment that mimics `in-vivo` phenomena. Second, biochemical conditions
can be well controlled, both in space and time, hence allowing to precisely fine tune
experimental conditions. Biomimetic systems are also particularly adapted to be combined with
optical traps, which allow us to study local mechanical properties of actin
networks with high temporal resolution. The combination of both allows us to get
insight into the variation of these mechanical properties as a function of
time and space, with high precision. 


During my PhD, I have focused on the mechanical properties of branched actin
networks polymerizing on optically trapped polystyrene beads. Such networks have already been
studied before :cite:`Kawska2012` but have been suspected to be highly
inhomogeneous. Optical traps allow to probe the mechanics of yet inaccessible parts of
the network.
I further studied actin
networks on other biomimetic systems constituted of liposomes, in order to better
understand the effect of actin cortex polymerisation on membrane tension and to
characterize network dynamics over time. Finally,  I participated in a
collaboration in order to understand the implication of such actin networks in
living mouse oocytes.

In vitro reconstituted actin networks
*************************************
.. 2

Living cells are complex organisms, for which each function requires a number
of interacting proteins and components. To understand the action of each
individual component, it is necessary to isolate or modify their actions
independently.

In order to achieve the precise tuning of each component independently, two
approaches are possible. First, an approach referred to  as "Top-Down", where
starting from the full system — in our case the cell — we will modify or remove
single or multiple components and study the global change of behavior. This is a complex
process that might be difficult to interpret, as biological systems often have
multiple pathways and feedback loops to regulate each of their processes. Taking into account the
large number of components that constitute a living cell, it is also 
difficult to come up with the minimal system required to replicate certain behaviors.

The other approach, also referred to as the bottom-up approach, requires
the reconstitution of the system part by part until it replicates the expected
behavior. This is also a complex process, as there is a large number of potential components  
likely to be added to the reconstituted system. This vast complexity
often leads to a wide range of testable parameters.
These controlled systems allow in principle for a deeper understanding of the governing
working mechanisms, and often permit access to a wider range of accessible
conditions and individual tweaking of components.

In our lab, we are mainly interested in the bottom-up approach and the use of
biomimetic systems. We try to reconstitute biologically relevant behavior within
minimal systems,  constituted from pure protein components.

I	n this manuscript in particular, we focus on mimicking the motility process
by which the `listeria` pathogen is able to hijack cellular mechanisms, by recruiting proteins
responsible for actin polymerisation at the leading edge of the cell, and use
them to polymerize actin on the pathogen surface. This is what allows 'listeria' to
propel itself fast enough (1.5 to 2 µm /min) :cite:`Dabiri1990` to be able to
penetrate the cell membrane to move from one cell to the other.

The bead motility system is a minimal `in-vitro` system capable of replicating
the listeria motility.

.. _bead-motility-assay:

Bead motility assay
===================
.. 3

The `Listeria` pathogen is a 1.5 to 5 micrometer cylindrical bacteria that
enters cells, hijacks its actin polymerisation machinery to propel itself and
infect neighbour cells. It does so by the recruitment of a single protein on its
surface : ActA, that activates the Arp2/3 complex. By the recruitment of Arp2/3, a
dense branched and entangled actin network grows that will eventually form a
comet behind the bacteria propelling it at the speed of actin comet
polymerisation. Listeria comets are composed of a wide range of proteins. It has
been shown :cite:`Loisel1999` that the number of required components can
be highly reduced, still maintaining the motility features. 


A simpler system replicating the listeria motility is the bead motility assay.
Consisting of a micrometer-sized bead covered with a nucleation promoting factor (NPF), it will activate the Arp2/3, present in the solution.

In the case of listeria, this NPF can be ActA, but such other NPF such as N-WASp or pVCA can also be used.
We chose pVCA in the experiments presented in this work. The NPF covered
bead is mixed with a G-Actin solution. Capping Protein is added to prevent
polymerisation from happening away from the bead surface as well as the
components required for actin polymerisation (ATP, Salt..., see :ref:`Material and methods <m_et_m>`) 

Due to the presence of Capping Protein in the solution and NPF on the surface of
the bead, the polymerisation of actin will only happen
on the bead surface, forming a thin and dense actin gel capable of sustaining stress, depending
on the different protein concentrations. Unlike listeria, which
seems to control on which of its sides the nucleation process happens, this is not
controlled in bead motility assays. In the right condition, though,
:cite:`Kawska2012` the dense actin gel formed on the bead surface can
accumulate the stress induced by the inner layer polymerisation, until symmetry
breaking occurs. The gel ruptures on one side of the bead, leading to
the formation of a comet on the opposite side (:num:`Figure #fig-bead-motility`).

.. _fig-bead-motility:
.. figure:: /figs/Plastino-Sykes-2005.png 
    :width: 60% 
    
    Scheme of bead motility assay. The NPF (yellow stars) will localize the
    actin polymerisation on the surface of the bead, thus increasing the stress on
    the outer actin layer. At a sufficient level of stress, the outer layer
    ruptures, leading to symmetry breaking, formation of a comet, and
    propulsion of the bead. Adapted from :cite:`Plastino2005`


Due to the further polymerisation of the actin network on the surface of the bead, 
the comet will grow, propelling the bead forward. This is the reason why the bead
system is a biomimetic system replicating the listeria motion.

It should be noted that during the movement of this system, two phases can be
distinguished. In the first phase, the system presents a spherical symmetry with
an homogeneous actin  network around the bead. The gel is growing from the
surface and is accumulating stress, due to the polymerisation of inner layers.

If the gel has accumulated sufficient stress by polymerisation,  the symmetry breaking event happens, and the system enters into
a second phase with the formation of a comet. 

The conditions that lead to symmetry breaking have been investigated in detail
:cite:`Kawska2012`. In the absence of Capping Protein, the actin polymerisation
does not seem to be restricted enough near the surface of the bead, and thus the formed
network is not able to generate or sustain enough stress to achieve symmetry
breaking. At high Capping Protein concentration, the growth of the gel is heavily impaired, 
thus preventing symmetry breaking. The concentration of Arp2/3 is also critical,
as Arp2/3 forms branched networks, and these branched networks are primordial essential for the
ability to sustain stress.

    :alt: Symmetry breaking phase diagram
    :width: 70% 

    Phase diagram showing symmetry breaking in bead motility assay as a
    function of concentration of Arp2/3 and Capping Protein. Symmetry breaking
    only occurs inside the area delimited by the dashed line on 4.5 µm beads, both
    `in vitro` and `in silico`. Experiments are
    displayed as inverted fluorescence image. Adapted from :cite:`Kawska2012`

In the rest of this chapter, we use the bead motility system, but only
consider it during the first phase, where the symmetry breaking has not yet
occurred, or in condition where it should not occur. In particular, we will
investigate a condition at 25 nM Arp2/3 with a concentration of Capping Protein
varying from 0 to 50 nM. As shown in :num:`fig #phase-diag` this range corresponds to
conditions where no symmetry breaking occurs, but also to conditions in which
symmetry breaking is expected.  It should be noted that unlike
other studies that also characterize actin network growing on beads
:cite:`Pujol2012`, our system is still dynamically polymerising and thus
changing with time.

Liposomes
=========
.. 3

Beads are used as a model biomimetic system that replicates the polymerisation mechanism
happening on the leading edge of cells. Because of their composition and
rigidity, the phenomenon observed on beads cannot necessarily reproduce all the interactions and
processes that take place on the cell membrane. Cells are finite compartments with a
limited amount of actin that acts on the dynamics of polymerisation.  The fact
that cell size is in the order of the persistence length of actin filaments
also plays a role on the structure of actin networks. Indeed, at these scales, a
single filament can never reach the length at which it can be considered fully
flexible.

Liposomes are one of the biomimetic systems able to capture some
interactions between cell membranes. Liposomes are lipid bilayers that imprison
an aqueous compartment and exhibit many characteristics similar to cells.
The inside of liposomes can act as a biochemical reactor of limited size, with
the lipid bilayer acting as a separation from the outside, like the cell
membrane. The composition of the lipid layer can be varied in order to reflect
the composition of a cell membrane. In particular, it is possible to attach
proteins to the liposome membrane. Finally, the size of the liposomes can be
varied, leading to actin networks, the size and shape of which are similar to those found in
cells.


It is possible to mimic the cellular actin cortex using liposomes, and especially
its contractility. A crosslinked actin network can be formed and attached to
the outer leaflet of liposomes, and contractility can be triggered by injecting
molecular motors. The behavior of the system will depend on the attachment
between the reconstituted actin cortex and the liposome membrane.  A weak attachment
leads to a favorable rupture of the actin cortex during the increase of tension,
implying a symmetry breaking, as in the bead motility system.  In the case of strong
attachment, the liposome actin-cortex will accumulate tension until it has
enough force to crush the supporting lipid layer, thus collapsing the liposome
:cite:`Carvalho2013`,(:num:`Figure #fig-peeling-scheme`). This system also allows the observation
over time, giving extra insight into the dynamics of the actin network (:num:`Figure #fig-peeling-3d`).

    the underlying liposome ruptures ("Crushing"). Adapted from

Membrane Physics 
****************
.. 2

The cell's plasma membrane is a biological membrane that separates the cell from
its outside environment.  It consists of a lipid bilayer containing
a high number of proteins.  A lipid bilayer is formed by two layers of lipids and has a
thickness of a few nm. The classical theoretical description
of these bilayers has been done by W. Helfrich :cite:`Helfrich` in 1973 in a
model based on the elasticity and fluidity of lipid bilayers as well as the
self assembly properties of  lipids.



In the case of a close lipid bilayer, the potential energy stored by the
deformation of a lipid bilayer by unit area can be  written as 

.. math::
    :label: eqa1

    H = H_{ext} + H_{curv}

In which :math:`H_{ext}` is due to the extension/compression of the membrane,
and :math:`H_{curv}` is due to the local curvature of the membrane.

The density of energy cost to extend the membrane :math:`H_{ext}` can be written as a
function  of the elastic area compressibility modulus :math:`K_a` and the
relative variation surface of the membrane :math:`A` :

.. math::
    :label: eqa2

    H_{ext} = \frac 1 2 K_a \left(\frac{\Delta A}{A}\right)^2

:math:`K_a` expresses how much energy is required to expand the surface of the
lipid bilayer and is due to the exposition of more hydrophobic surface to water
when expanding it. :math:`K_a` is expressed in :math:`J.m^{-2}`, or :math:`N/m`
and is close to twice the surface tension between the lipids and water.


For closed lipid bilayers, the total curvature energy can be expressed as the
sum of the curvature energy :math:`H_{curv}` :


.. math::
    :label: eqa3

    H_{cur} = \frac 1 2 \kappa (c_1 + c_2 -c_0)^2

In which :math:`kappa` is the bending modulus of the membrane and :math:`c_1,c_2`
are the principal curvatures of the membrane. :math:`c_0` is the spontaneous
curvature of the membrane, which is defined as the curvature the membrane would adopt, when free of
external constraints.

.. |sigma| replace:: :math:`\sigma`
.. |Hext| replace:: :math:`H_{ext}`

An important parameter introduced in membrane mechanics is the  membrane tension,
|sigma| which is the stress associated with an increase in the membrane surface.
The tension |sigma| is linked to the energy required to expand the membrane |Hext| by :

.. math::
    :label: eqa4

    \sigma &= \frac {\partial H} {\partial \left(\frac{\Delta A}{A}\right)} \\

i.e.

.. math::
    :label: eqa5

    H_{ext} &= \sigma\left( \frac {\Delta A} A \right)

In which 

.. math::
    :label: eqa6a

    \sigma =  K_a \left( \frac {\Delta A} A \right)


Membrane tension is a key parameter as it can be measured in cells. It is one
of the parameters responsible for cell sorting :cite:`Maitre2012`. In particular
between cells, the tension of the couple (membrane+actin cortex) can be
determined by using the contact angle between cells which is the angle between
interfaces, as defined in :num:`figure #fig-tension-cell`.


.. _fig-tension-cell:
.. figure:: /figs/Cell-Surface-tension.png
    :alt: nothing
    :width: 40%

    Surface tension governs doublet shape,  adapted from :cite:`Maitre2012`.
    The equilibrium of forces on the contact line governs the angle of contact
    :math:`2.\theta`. :math:`\omega` corresponds to the adhesion tension between
    the two cells, :math:`\sigma_{cm}` corresponds  to the tension between
    the cell and the medium, :math:`\sigma_{cc}` corresponds to the cortex
    tension between the two cells. 

In a later part, we use a reconstituted biomimetic system made of liposomes. The
injection of myosin motors changes the tension of the acto-myosin cortex
attached to a membrane. By determining the geometrical parameters of this
system, and in particular the evolution of the contact angle with time, we are
able to measure the variation of tension of the acto-myosin cortex due to the contraction by
molecular motors.


.. _viscoelastic:

Actin networks as viscoelastic material
***************************************
.. 2

We have previously seen that while polymerising, G-actin assembles into F-actin
filaments. The stiffness of filaments can be measured by a characteristic number
called the persistence length (:math:`l_p`). More precisely, the
persistence length characterizes the average loss of correlation between the
tangents along the considered polymer. With :math:`s` the curvilinear abscissae along the polymer, 
and :math:`\Theta_{(x,y)}` the angle between the two tangents at two different abscissae (:num:`Figure #fig-persistence-length`):


.. math::
    :label: eqa6

    \left<\Theta_{(s,s+l)}\right> = exp\left(\frac{-l}{l_p}\right)

For actin filaments, the
persistence length is in the order of 10 µm :cite:`Isambert1995`. This means
that for much smaller scales, the actin filament can be considered as rigid.
This is the case in the cell cortex where the meshwork has a typical size, smaller than 250 nm. In
the other extreme, at length scale much bigger than :math:`l_p`, filaments can
be considered as flexible. While in typical cells, the filament length is
rarely much bigger than the persistence length of actin, `Xenopus` eggs can be
reach 1 mm, so hundreds fold the actin persistence length.
Still, for the majority of cells, the typical size we are interested in
is about the persistence length of an actin filament, thus at this scale, the filament can neither be considered purely
rigid nor completely flexible.

    length (A), in the order of the persistence length (B) and small compared
    to persistence length (C), :math:`s` as defined on (B) is the `curvilinear
    abscissae`, that is to say the distance between two points of the polymer,
    measured by "following" the polymer. Adapted from :cite:`Liverpool2006`


For the above reasons, actin solutions are often compared to semi-flexible
polymers, and models that predict the behavior of actin networks often take
foundation on polymers physics :cite:`Morse1998b` :cite:`Morse1998a`. Still, if
these models rely on local microscopic parameters, experimental methods only
have access to bulk properties of the studied material, and it is from these
properties, and through the models, that we can deduce possible values for the
microscopic models :cite:`MacKintosh1995`. 


.. _elastic_modulus:

Elastic Modulus
================
.. 3

The elastic moduli are probably the easiest to understand. They are
characteristic of how a material will deform non-permanently under an applied
force. The stiffer something is, the higher its elastic moduli will be. There
are two specific elastic moduli of interest in this
manuscript, `Young's Modulus` and `shear modulus`. The first one describes how a material will react to compression or extension, while the
second describes how a material resists  shearing. For isotropic and homogeneous
materials, the Young's modulus (E) and the shear models (G) are related
by the Poisson's ratio (:math:`\nu`):

.. math::
    :label: eqa7
    
    G = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}


Both G and E units are homogeneous to :math:`N/m^2` or
:math:`Pa`.  It is instructive to have an idea of the order of magnitude of a
few usual materials. Aluminium will have an elastic modulus :math:`G_{Al}\simeq
70~GPa` while rubber will be more in the order of :math:`G_{rubber}\simeq
0.1~GPa`. The elastic modulus of muscle cell is in the order of
:math:`G_{muscle} \sim 10~kPa` and brain tissues around :math:`G_{brain} \sim
0.1~\text{to}~1~kPa` :cite:`Engler2006`.


A  more formal definition of the Young's modulus is the ratio between
the stress :math:`\sigma` along the direction of the deformation and the relative deformation :math:`\epsilon`. 

.. math:: 
    :label: eqa8
    
    E &= \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} \\
      & = \frac{   F/S }{   \Delta L / L_0        }

In which :math:`F` is the applied force, :math:`S` is the cross section of the
material, :math:`\Delta L` is the elongation and :math:`L_0` is the initial
length of the considered material.  (:num:`Figure #fym` A):

.. _fym:
.. figure:: /figs/youngm.png
    :width: 80%
    :alt: Definition of Young’s modulus
    
    Schematic of the Young Modulus definition. F, force applied to a sample, S
    surface of cross section when uncompressed, :math:`L_0`, length when no load
    is applied. For both compression and extension, in the regime of small
    deformation, the relative change of length is proportional to the applied
    force. Here, the material can be seen to expand/contract in the orthogonal direction
    to the direction of the, applied force. In the case of an
    incompressible material (:math:`\nu = 0.5`) this can be seen as the
    conservation of the material volume.

The shear modulus is defined for a deformation, parallel to the surface on which it is applied :

.. math::
    :label: eqa9

    G &= \frac{\tau_{xy}}{\gamma_{xy}} \\
      & = \frac{   F/S }{   \Delta x / l        }

.. .. _fgm:
.. .. figure:: /figs/shearm.png
..     :width: 50%
.. 
..     Schematic of deformation for the shear modulus.

In which :math:`\tau_{xy}` is the shear stress, :math:`\gamma_{xy}` is the shear strain, :math:`F` is the applied force
on the cross section of the material :math:`S`. :math:`l` is the thickness of the material and :math:`\Delta x` is the 
transverse displacement (:num:`Figure #fym` B).


Other characteristic numbers can also be defined, such as the bulk modulus. In the case of isotropic
elastic materials, only two of those parameters are required to completely define
the properties of the material. 

Poisson's Ratio
===============
.. 3

We have seen that the shear modulus is linked to the Young modulus using
the Poisson's ratio. It is another characteristic of a material
that defines how much a material will compress/expand in the orthogonal directions to its elongation. 
The Poisson's ratio is the negative ratio of transverse to axial strain :

.. math::
    :label: eqa10

    \nu = - \frac{
        d \epsilon_{trans}
    }{
        d \epsilon_{axial}
    }

In which :math:`\epsilon_{axial}` is the relative deformation along one of the
axis of compression/elongation and :math:`\epsilon_{trans}` corresponds to the
relative deformation along an axis, orthogonal to the axis of deformation.

Volume conservation during compression or elongation requires
a Poisson's ratio of `0.5`. Such values have been found in bulk measurements of
actin networks at actin concentrations of 21.5 µM in G-actin :cite:`Gardel2003`. Materials with a Poisson's ratio of `0.5` are
said to be incompressible. A Poisson's ratio lower than `0.5` corresponds to materials
expanding less than incompressible materials, and some cells and tissues are known to
have a Poisson's ratio lower than 0.5 :cite:`Mahaffy2004`. Another critical value
is 0, where the materials only expand or contract in the direction of the
main stress.

Materials with a Poisson's ratio superior to 0.5 would show a bigger
deformation in the orthogonal direction than incompressible materials, leading
to a global volume increase, if compressed. 



Viscosity
=========
.. 3

Like elasticity, viscosity is something tangible we are used to work with in
everyday life. The more viscous a material is, the more difficult it is to move
something in it, at high speed. And indeed, viscosity is the pendant of the elastic
modulus, but considering forces induced by the deformation rate instead of displacement 

.. math::
    :label: eqa12
    
    \frac{F}{S} &= \tau_{xy} \\
                &= \eta \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}

In which :math:`\tau_{xy}` is the shear stress, :math:`F` is the force exerted
on the surface :math:`S`. :math:`\eta` is the viscosity, and is expressed in
:math:`Pa.s`, :math:`v` is the deformation rate along the direction :math:`z` .



At room temperature, water has a viscosity of around 1 mPa.s, and honey of 10 Pa.s. The consideration of viscosity in problems will
often depend on the timescale and deformation rate. At a short
timescale, tissue often behaves elastic, whereas at a long timescale, the effect
of viscosity will be seen :cite:`Thoumine1997`. In actin networks, the effect of
viscosity at short time scale can be similar to elasticity :cite:`Gardel2003`. 



Viscoelasticity
===============
.. 3

Typically, no material is purely elastic or purely viscous. While glaciers 
seem purely solid at the time scale of a few days, observation on a longer time
scale, ranging from months to years, show that ice is not only a
solid, but can also flow. Of course, ice in its solid form is not the only
material which is both solid and viscous. In order to describe such
behaviour, one can use the theory of viscoelastic materials.  A number of models have
been and are still developed to describe viscoelastic behavior. The
Kelvin-Voigt and Maxwell models are two of the simpler ones (:num:`Figure #fig-mkv`). A thought
experiment, conducted to understand each of these models, consists of putting a spring and a dash pot
in parallel or series. Such model systems exhibit viscoelastic behavior.

    Maxwell model schematic on the left and Kelvin-Voigt model on the right.
    Both are simple approaches to express the properties of a viscoelastic
    solid. The response to a creep compliance will differ in both cases. The Maxwell
    model will mostly behave like a fluid with viscosity :math:`\eta` after a
    long time, whereas the Kelvin-Voigt model will mostly reflect the elastic
    components at constant exerted stress. (Schematic in Public Domain, adapted
    from Wikimedia).

The idea for more complex models is similar: any material can be considered as an
(infinite) combination of springs (for elasticity), and dash-pots, (for viscosity).

The theory of viscoelastic materials explains the mechanical properties of a system by
using a single parameter: the viscoelasticity of a material. This can
be done by describing :math:`E` as a relaxation modulus depending on time.  In
the case of a linear system, we can express the strain on the material at a given
time, as a function of its history :

.. math::
    :label: strain

    \sigma (t)  = \int_{-\infty}^t E(t-\tau) \frac{du}{d\tau} d\tau

In which :math:`\sigma(t)` is the time dependent stress, and :math:`u(t)` is
the known strain.

Through the use of rheology, it is common to measure the properties of a material using a
sinusoidal strain of known amplitude :math:`u_0` and frequency :math:`f =
\omega/ 2.\pi` : :math:`u(t) = u_0.cos(\omega t)`, which also implies a
sinusoidal strain rate. Using the complex notation :math:`\dot u = u_0 i\omega
e^{i\omega t}` in equation :eq:`strain`, and operating the change of variable :math:`t-\tau \to t'`  leads to :

.. math:: 
    :label: eqa13

    \sigma(t) = u_0\int_0^\infty E(t') i\omega e^{i\omega(t-t')}dt'

By factoring out the time dependent part, the rest can be rewritten as two integrals with respectively a real and an imaginary prefactor: 

.. math::
    :label: eqt

    \sigma(t) = u_0e^{i\omega t}\times\left(
              \omega \int_0^\infty E(t')  sin(\omega t) dt' 
              +
            i \omega \int_0^\infty E(t') cos(\omega t) dt' 
    \right)

 
The two integrals in brackets only depend on the pulsation :math:`\omega` and the properties of the considered material. 
They are both in factors of the complex strain :math:`u(t) = u_0 e^{i\omega t}`. 
We thus define the storage modulus of the material as the real part of (:eq:`eqt` in bracket) :math:`E'` : 

.. math::
    :label: eqa14

    E'(\omega) =  \omega \int_0^\infty E(t')  sin(\omega t) dt' 

And the loss modulus as the imaginary part of (:eq:`eqt` in bracket) 
    
.. math::
    :label: eqa15

    E"(\omega) =  \omega \int_0^\infty E(t')  cos(\omega t) dt' 

And define the complex frequency dependent Young's modulus as :

.. math::
    :label: eqa16

    E^*(\omega) = E'(\omega) + i.E"(\omega)

.. :math:`\otimes`


Thus we can write :eq:`eqt` as : 

.. math::
    :label: eqa17

    \sigma(\omega) = E^*(\omega).u(\omega)


In this representation of :math:`E^*(\omega)`, the real part will correspond to
the elastic response of the material (in-phase response
under oscillatory strain) and the imaginary part corresponds to the viscous response
of the system (out of phase under sinusoidal strain). The complete knowledge of
:math:`E^*(\omega)` at all frequencies completely characterizes the material.

Models for actin networks have been extensively studied as viscoelastic material
both theoretically :cite:`Morse1998a`, :cite:`Kruse2005` , and  experimentally
:cite:`Mizuno2007`. Actin networks have also been shown to exhibit linear characteristic behavior,
but at certain concentration ranges, a non-linear behavior has also been observed :cite:`Yao2011`, :cite:`Gardel2003`. 

The actin networks we will study hereafter, being in the condition where a linear behavior is expected, we will thus use the viscoelastic theory to interpret the
observed relation stress/strain, in order to determine the mechanical properties
of the formed actin gels.

Optical tweezers, or optical traps, are a technique that allows to trap objects
near the focal plane of a microscope, at the focal point of a high-power laser.
It is a versatile technique that allows to trap both fabricated objects and
parts of living cells. Optical traps typically allow to apply forces up to a few tenth of
pico Newton. 

In order to understand that light can trap an object, it is instructive to keep in mind
that, despite having no mass, photons carry momentum and that, as for any massive
object, changing the trajectory requires a force.  According to Newton's third
law, when applying a force via a photon on an object, the object will in turn
exert the opposite force on the photon, thus changing its trajectory. If a photon changes its trajectory in a material, the material has to apply a
force on it(:num:`Figure #setup`), meaning that the photon also applies a force on the
material. In particular, the higher the refractive index of a material, the
more light beams are deviated, and hence the more photons apply forces on
material.

More specifically, it can be shown that objects with a higher refractive
index than the surrounding medium, are attracted towards higher light intensities
(:num:`Figure #setup`).  In particular, laser beams with a Gaussian intensity
profile, will lead to the object being attracted towards their center. 

In addition to the lateral trapping, the laser focus leads to
another intensity gradient along the direction of beam propagation, the intensity being at its maximum at the laser waist. 

So, a laser coupled into a microscope objective acts as a three dimensional
potential that traps particles, similar to a tweezer. Usually the trapping in
a parallel to the laser direction, is only about half as strong if compared to the trapping in the
lateral direction.

.. _setup:
.. figure:: /figs/ot1.png
    :alt: schematic of setup plus one
    :width: 70%

    Light deflected by a transparent bead changes the light momentum, so the
    light is exerting a force on the bead, which will be attracted towards
    the highest intensity.  For a focused laser beam, the bead will be attracted
    near the laser focus.



Among the qualities of optical traps, one is that in principle, multiple traps can be
obtained. A simple method to generate two traps is to split the incoming light
into two orthogonally polarized independent beams.  Instead of sharing the
laser power between the different traps by using polarisation, one can use what
is known as multiplexing by time sharing. This is achieved by rapidly switching the laser
between different positions at a much faster speed than the diffusion of the particles. By using this method,
it is possible to virtually achieve multiple traps on the same
sample. 

In this work, we use a multiplexed system, where the rapid switching is achieved, by means of Accousto Optic Deflectors
(aka AODs).  An AOD consists of a crystal in which a high frequency
sound-wave propagates perpendicular to the incoming laser beam. This sound-wave generates local changes in the
refractive index of the material, which acts as a diffraction grating. In
the right conditions, a laser passing through the crystal will
be deflected by this grating under the Bragg angle.

In practice, rapidly controlling the frequency and amplitude of the sound-wave
in the crystal, allow direct adjustment of laser deflection and hence the
trap position. Not only does the use of AODs offer the advantage of controlling
the number and position of multiple traps, but also the individual power allocated to each trap, hence their stiffness.

    A schematic of  setup used. The following elements can be distinguished. An
    1064nm laser is used for trapping. It first passes through two AODs that
    move the position of the trap in the X  and Y direction.  The first couple
    of lenses (L1,L2) between AODs assures that AODs are in conjugated planes.
    The second pair of lenses (L3,L4) image the AODs plane in the back-focal plane
    of the first objective.
    Thus, a change of angle of the light beam induced by the AOD, 
    results in a  change of the trap position.  The trapping light
    is collected by a second objective, and illuminates a quadrant photodiode
    (QPD) conjugated to the back focal plane of the collecting objective. By
    construction, QPD and AODs should be conjugated, so the deviation of the light
    beam induced by one of the AODs is not supposed to induce any change of
    the laser spot position on the QPD. Additional dichroic mirrors allow to
    use bright field and epifluorescence simultaneously with the optical
    tweezer.

A schematic of the optical setup used to trap beads in the focal
plane on the microscope, can be found in :num:`figure #ots`. The scheme also
contains the detection part of the setup used to measure the force
exerted on each bead, technique which is explained in the following part.


Determination of trapping forces and bead displacement
======================================================
.. 3


In addition to allowing the objects to be held in place, the use of a QDP
(Quadrant Photo Diode, a precise position detector) with optical traps, has the
advantage to acquire the high frequency quantitative measurements of the
displacement and force exerted on an object.  Indeed, when the trapped particle
is not in the trap center, the laser applies a force on the object.
Reciprocally, the object applies the opposite force on the light beam, thus
deflecting it.  With a proper use of optics and lenses correctly placed on the
Fourier plane of the sample, it is hence possible to translate this orientation
change of the light  beam into a displacement of a light spot, onto a photo
detector with high sensitivity to applied forces.

Through a careful calibration of the trap, which gives the force/displacement
relationship, :cite:`Jahnel2011`, :cite:`Vermeulen2006`, one can then also
recover the sample displacement inside the optical trap.

Using an optical tweezer, not only aiming at holding a particle in position, but also at getting a
quantitative measurement of its displacement and the exerted force, requires to 
calibrated each probe particle. Polystyrene beads are common artificial probes, 
used to achieve such a goal.

The use of polystyrene beads has multiple advantages. First, one
can obtain mono-dispersed beads, leading to reproducible and predictable trap
stiffness. Secondly, theory can predict the shape of
the potential felt by such a bead in a Gaussian beam :cite:`Nieminen2007`.

    
The third advantage is that beads can be fictionalized, allowing specific
interaction to be controlled, both `in vitro` and `in vivo`. Of course, the
calibration is essential for the correct measurement of the different systems mechanical property
, and the choice of the bead diameter has an impact both on
the biological side and in the measurement physics.
