During my PhD I decided to investigate the effect of actin network on the
mechanical properties of cells. Indeed, mechanical properties of cell are a key
parameter that has a crucial impact on cell and organism function. Being able
to detect changes in mechanical properties, and understand the mechanism that
govern these changes  is an important step to be able to apprehend the behavior
of cells, distinguish healthy cells and tissues from malignant ones.
Understanding the mechanism as the origin of cell motion and change in shape is
also a decisive step in controlling cell behavior, and being able to prevent
cancer sells invasion and division without impairing healthy cells.

During the last three years, I decided to focus on biomimetic system and
establish characteristic of actin network. Actin is a highly conserved
component across the living domain, and it plays a major role in cells
mechanics. By interacting with a number of other component of the cell, actin
is able to form a various number of networks. It is on such networks, and in
controlled condition that I decided to focus my research. 

Along this dissertation we will mainly focus on three systems.

On the first one, we reconstitute an already observed actin network — the actin
cortex — on a biomimetic system, then show that from this network emanate a
second sparse actin network previously unseen, and characterize its mechanical
properties. We developed the idea that the effect of this second network cannot
be neglected in cell and investigate a few of the phenomenon it can be involved
in.

As the effect of such a sparse actin has not been demonstrated we decided to
investigate the effect of another sparse actin network on a living cell. In
collaboration with College de France, we studied the mechanical properties
inside mouse oocyte. We see in this system that actin related proteins have
hi-impact on the structure and the mechanics both of the cell and the actin
network in it. 

Characterizing the dynamics of a network in a living cell by controlling the
condition is complex.  To characterize the dynamics and properties of actin
networks on the effect of linkage between the actin-cortex and the cell
membrane, we developed a new biomimetic system. This system of "doublets" allow
to measure the variation of tensions generated by an acto-myosin cortex with
time. The doublet system is composed by a doublet of two liposomes covered by
an actin network. Imaging with Spinning disk microscopy, we are able to
reconstruct changes in the acto-myosin network and deduce the changes in its
properties from the change in geometry.

Introduction

Cells are the basic component of living organisms. Understanding their
individual behavior and the way they function is a key step to understand
how they interact with their environment. One of the key components within most
cells is actin, a protein which is highly conserved across the species and plays
an important role for the cell mechanics, from cell migration to cell differentiation
and division. It plays also a non negligible role in mechanical properties of
the cell and its interactions with the environment. Under the cell membrane lies a 
thin actin layer which controls mechanical properties of the cell: 
the actin cortex. The mechanical behavior of this actin cortex is itself driven
by the dynamics and interactions of the actin network  it is made off.
Understanding this actin network is hence a key to learn how the actin
cortex behaves, leading to a better understanding of cells and tissues. 

The properties of an actin network highly depend on its structure. The
structure itself depends on many parameters that influenced how the network is
formed.  The network structure and formation is influence by physical and
chemical conditions. The spatial and temporal variation of these parameters like
stress and ion-concentration can determine the fate of a network. Hence it is though
important to study these networks and their dynamics in order to grasp the
changing structure of the cell.


Cells are complex systems that adapt their shape, mechanical properties and
biochemical conditions permanently. The spatial repartition of theses
properties is also variable as the cell regulates the concentration of proteins
all across its cytoplasm. To well study the effect of each component independently,
it is crucial to study actin networks in a controlled environment.

Biomimetic systems allow to respond to most of these concerns, they provide a
controlled environment that mimic `in-vivo` phenomenon. Biochemical conditions
can be well controlled, both in space and time allowing to precisely fine tune
experimental conditions. Biomimetic system are also particularly adapted to be combined with
optical traps which allow us to study local mechanical properties of actin
networks with a high time resolution. The combination of both allows us to get
insight into the variation of theses mechanical properties as a function of
time and space with a high precision. 


During my PhD,  I have focused on the study of the mechanics of branched actin
networks polymerizing on optically trapped polystyrene beads. Such networks where
studied before :cite:`Kawska2012` but have been suspected to be highly
inhomogeneous. Optical traps allowed to probe mechanics of parts of
the network which had been  unaccessible before.
I further studied actin
networks on other biomimetic systems constituted of liposomes, in order to better
understand the effect of actin cortex polymerisation on membrane tension and
characterize network dynamic over time. Finally,  I participated in a
collaboration in order to understand the implication such actin network in
living mouse oocytes.

In vitro reconstituted actin networks
*************************************
.. 2

Living cells are complex organism, for which each function may require a number
of interacting proteins and components. To understand the action of each
individual component it is needed to isolate of modify their actin
independently.

In order to achieve the  precise tuning of each component independently two
approach are envisageable. An approach referred to  as "Top-Down" where
starting from the full system — in our case the cell — we will modify or remove
each of the component and study the global change of behavior. It is a complex
process that might be difficult to interpret as biological system have often
multiple pathways and feedback loop to regulate each of their process. With the
large number of component that constitute a living cell, it is also relatively
difficult to come up with the minimal system necessary to replicate a behavior.

The other approach, also referred to as the  bottom-up approach, require to
reconstitute the system  component by component until it replicate the expected
behavior. It is also a complex process, as there are a large of component to
chose from that can potentially be added to the reconstituted system, but often
lead to a wider range for the testable parameter as well as minimal number of
interacting component. This allow for a deeper understanding of the governing
principle of the system, and often permit access to a wider range of accessible
conditions and individual tweaking of component.

In our lab we are mainly interested in the bottom-up approach and the use of
biomimetic system. We try to reconstitute biologically relevant behavior with
the minimal system constituted from pure protein components.

In particular in this manuscript we are interested in the mimicking the process
by which the listeria is able to hijack cellular mechanism, recruit proteins
responsible for actin polymerisation at the leading edge of the cell, and use
hem to polymerize actin on its back. This is what allow the listeria to
propel itself fast enough (1.5 to 2 µm /sec) :cite:`Dabiri1990` to be able to
pass through cell membrane from one cell to the other.

The bead motility system is the minimal in-vitro system capable of replicating
the listeria motility.

.. _bead-motility-assay:

Bead motility assay
===================
.. 3

Listeria is 1.5 to 5 micrometer cylindrical bacteria that enter cells, hijack
its actin polymerisation machinery to propel itself and infect neighbourers
cells. It does so by the recruitment of single protein to its read end : ActA.
ActA activate the Arp2/3 complex. From the recruited Arp2/3 will grow a dense
branched and entangle actin network that will for a comet behind the bacteria
propelling the bacteria at the speed of actin comet polymerisation. Listeria
comets are composed of a wide range of protein, it has though been shown
:cite:`Loisel1999` that the number of required component can be highly reduced.


The simpler system that can replicate the listeria motility is the bead
motility assay, it consist of a micrometer-sized bead covered with a nucleation
promoting factor that will activate Arp2/3 present in solution.  This NPF can
be ActA as in the case of listeria, but one can use other NPF like N-WASp or
pVCA as we will do in the rest of this manuscript. The NPF covered bead is in a
solution where G-Actin is present. Capping Protein is added to prevent the
polymerisation from happening away from the bead surface as well as the
component necessary for actin polymerisation (ATP, Salt...) 

Due to the presence of Capping Protein in solution and NPF on the surface of
the bead, the polymerisation of actin will happened only on the surface on the
bead forming a thin and dens actin gel capable of sustaining stress depending
on on the different protein concentration. Unlike in the case of listeria which
control on which if its side the nucleation process happens, this is not
controlled on bead motility assay. Though, in the right condition
:cite:`Kawska2012` the dense actin gel formed on the bead surface can
accumulate stress induce by polymerisation of inner layer until symmetry
breaking occurs. The gels ruptures on one of the side of he bead, leading to
the formation on a comet on the opposite side.

.. figure:: /figs/Plastino-Sykes-2005.png 
    :width: 60% 
    
    Scheme of bead motility assay. The NPF (yellow stars) will localize the
    actin polymerisation on the surface of the bead thus increasing stress on
    the outer actin layers. At a sufficient level of stress, the outer layer
    ruptures, leading to symmetry breaking, formation of a comet, and
    propulsion of the bead. Adapted from :cite:`Plastino2005`


The further polymerisation of the actin network on the surface of the bead will
make the comet grow, propelling the bead forward. This is what make the bead
system a biomimetic system replicating the listeria motion.

It should be noted that during the evolution of this system, two phases can be
distinguished. In the first phase, the system present a spherical symmetry with
an homogeneous actin  network around the bead. The gel is growing from the
surface and is accumulating stress due to the polymerisation of inner layers.

If the gel to able of accumulate sufficient stress, by polymerisation,  the symmetry breaking event happens, and the system enters in
a second phase with the formation of a comet. 

The condition that lead to symmetry breaking are investigated in
:cite:`Kawska2012`. In the absence of Capping Protein, the actin polymerisation seem
not to be restricted enough near the surface of the bead, and the formed
network is not able to generate or sustain enough stress to achieve symmetry
breaking. At high Capping Protein concentration, the growth of the gel is too impaired
to also permit symmetry breaking. The concentration of Arp2/3 is also critical
as Arp2/3 form branched network, and these branched network are primordial for the
ability to sustain stress.

    function of concentration of Arp2/3 and Capping Protein. Symmetry breaking
    only occurs inside the area delimited by dashed line. Experiments are
    displayed as inverted fluorescence image. Adapted from :cite:`Kawska2012`

In the rest of this manuscript we use the bead motility system but only consider
it during the first phase, where the symmetry breaking has not yet occurred, or
in condition where it should not occur. In particular we will investigate
condition at 25 nM Arp2/3 and concentration of Capping Protein varying from 0
to 50 nM. This correspond in :num:`Fig #phase-diag` to both condition where no
symmetry breaking can occurs, but also to condition to which symmetry occurs
happens with the highest probability. This first phase where the gel is still
homogeneous around the bead has already been studied in :cite:`Pujol2012`, who
measure the stiffness of the thin actin gels that form near the surface of the
bead.We focus on fixed system where we will do further study on still
polymerising system.

Liposomes
=========
.. 3

Bead are a model biomimetic system that replicate the polymerisation mechanism
that happened on the leading edge of the cell. Because of their composition and
rigidity phenomenon observed on bead cannot reproduce all the interaction and
process that take place on cell membrane. Cells are finite compartment with a
limited amount of actin that act on the dynamic of polymerisation.  The fact
that cell size is in the order of the persistence length of actin filament
also play a role on the structure of actin network. Indeed at these scale as a
single filament can never reach the length at which is can be considers a fully
flexible.

Liposomes are one of the biomimetic system that are capable of capturing these
interaction between cell membrane. Liposomes are lipid bilayers that imprison
an aqueous compartment and exhibit many extra characteristic similar to cells.
The inside of liposomes can act as a biochemical reactor of limited size with
the lipid bilayer actin as a separation with the outside, like the cell
membrane. The composition of the lipid layer can be varied in order to reflect
the composition of cell membrane. In particular it is possible to attach
protein to the liposomes membrane. Finally the size of the liposomes can be
varied, leading to actin network of size and shape similar to those found in
cells.


It is possible to mimic the cell actin cortex using liposomes, and especially
its contractility. A crosslinked actin network, can be formed and attached to
the outer leaflet of liposomes, and contractility can be trigged by injecting
molecular motors. The behavior of the system will depend on the attachment
between the reconstituted actin cortex and liposomes membrane.  Week attachment
lead to a favorable rupture of the actin cortex during the increase of tension,
implying a symmetry breaking as in bead system.  In the case of strong
attachment the liposomes actin cortex will accumulate tension until it has
enough force to crush the supporting lipid layer thus collapsing the liposomes
:cite:`Carvalho2013`. This system also allow the observation of the system
through time giving extra insight into the dynamic of actin network.

    underlying liposome ruptures ("Crushing"). Adapted from :cite:`Carvalho2013`

    reconstruction done by Joël Lemière.



Membrane Physics 
****************
.. 2

The membrane of living cell is a complex, being the host a large number of
interacting proteins and lipids each with their own dynamics. Though at the
scale of cell and liposomes it is interest to model the membrane as a surface
(that is to say without thickness) characterized by global mechanical properties.

In the case of closed lipid bilayers, the mechanical property we are interested
in resume to the expansion modulus :math:`K_a` and the bending modulus
:math:`K_b`. The value of theses two constant will vary depending on the
protein and lipid that are present in each of the two leaflet of the lipid
bilayer.


The expansion modulus :math:`K_a` express how much energy need to by used to
expand the surface of the lipid bilayer and is due to the exposition of more
hydrophobic surface to water when expanding it. :math:`K_a` is expressed in
:math:`J.m^{-2}`, or :math:`N/m` and is close to 2 time the surface tension between the
lipids and water.

Thus the formalism of surface tension is often used  as physical models in cell
and liposomes. This allow to link the difference of pressure between two side
of a membrane to the membrane tension and its curvature; also known as Laplace Law : 

.. math::
    \Delta P = \gamma \left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)

Where :math:`{R_1}` and :math:`{R_2}` are the principal curvatures radius which
are equal in the case of sphere. This technique allow for the measure of tension on liposome or cortical tension of cell using aspiration :cite:`Chaigne2013a`. 

.. figure:: /figs/Cell-Surface-tension.png
    :alt: nothing
    :width: 40%

    Surface tension govern doublet shape,  adapted from :cite:`Maitre2012`.
    The equilibrium of forces on the contact line govern the angle of contact.

When more than two regions of space are in contact with each other at the same
location, they form a contact line. The displacement of this contact line often
lead to the change of contact area between each region which makes the
reasoning on surface tension and energy difficult. Though the problem can be
reinterpreted by considering that each interface exerted a force on each unit
length of the contact line. The force exerted by each interface is proportional
to the surface tension of the interface and tangent to it on the contact line.
Most problem can thus be resolved by looking at the equilibrium of the contact
line and solve the condition for which the force on it equilibrate. In such
cases, the contact angle on the contact line is a key parameter in the relation
between each tensions. The measure of contact angle can be use to derive the
relation of cell membrane+cortex tension between cells in contact
:cite:`Maitre2012`

Actin networks as viscoelastic material
***************************************
.. 2

We have seen previously that while polymerising, G-actin assemble into F-actin
filaments. The stiffness of filament can be measured by a characteristic number
called the persistence length (:math:`l_p`) which represent the length after
which the bending of filament becomes non-negligible. More precisely, the
persistence length characterise the average loss of correlation between the
tangent along the considered polymer. With :math:`s` the curvilinear abscissae along the polymer, and :math:`\Theta_{(x,y)}` the angle between the two tangent at two different abscissae:

.. math::
    \left<\Theta_{(s,s+l)}\right> = exp\left(\frac{-l}{l_p}\right)

For actin filaments, the
persistence length is in the order of 10 µm :cite:`Isambert1996`. This means
that for scales much smaller, the actin filament can be considered as rigid,
like in cell cortex where meshwork have a typical size smaller than 250 nm. In
the other extreme, at length scale much bigger than :math:`l_p`, filaments can
be considered as flexible. Even if for typical cells, the length scale is
rarely much bigger than the persistence length of actin, `Xenopus` eggs can be
as big as 1 mm, so hundreds fold the actin persistence length. In mouse oocyte that
can go up to a 80µm diameter – and on which we will do some analysis – actin
filaments are hence about an order of magnitude bigger than the persistence
length. Still for the majority of cells, the typical size we are interested in
is about the persistence length of an actin filament, making it neither purely
rigid nor completely flexible.

For the above reasons, solution of actin are often compared to semi-flexible
polymers, and models that predict comportment of actin network often take
foundation on polymers physics :cite:`Morse1998` :cite:`Morse1998a`. Still, if
theses models rely on local microscopic parameter, experimental methods only
have access to bulk properties of the studied material, and it is from theses
properties, and through the models that we can deduce possible values for the
microscopic models :cite:`MacKintosh1995`. 


.. _elastic_modulus:

Elastics Modulus
================
.. 3

The elastics moduli are probably the easiest to understand. They are
characteristic of how a material will deform non permanently under applied
force. The stiffer something is the higher its elastics moduli will be. There
are two specific elastic moduli we will be interested in in the rest of this
manuscript, `Young's Modulus` and `shear modulus`. The first one describe more
specially how material will react to it's compression or extension, while the
second describe how a material resists  shearing. In isotropic and homogeneous
material, the Young modulus (noted E) and the shear models (G) are proportional
by a factor depending on the Poisson ratio (:math:`\nu`) by the following relation:

.. math::
    
    G = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}


Hence at fixed Poisson ratio, and as :math:`\nu` is usually around a value of
:math:`0.5`, it is common to use G and E interchangeably and to just referee to
it as "elastic modulus". Both G and E units are homogeneous to :math:`N/m^2` or
:math:`Pa`.  It is interesting to have an idea of the oder of magnitude of a
few usual materials. Aluminum will have an elastic modulus :math:`G_{Al}\simeq
70~GPa` while rubber will be more in the order of :math:`G_{rubber}\simeq
0.1~GPa`. The elastic modulus of muscle cell is in the order of
:math:`G_{muscle} \sim 10~kPa` and brain tissues around :math:`G_{brain} \sim
0.1~\text{to}~1~kPa`.


For a  more formal definition of the Young moduli, it is the ratio between
the stress along the direction of the deformation by the relative elongation. 
It is then proportional to the force by unit of surface applied divided by the relative elongation:

.. math:: 
    
    E &= \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} \\
      & = \frac{   F/S }{   \Delta L / L_0        }


.. figure:: /figs/youngm.png
    :width: 50%
    :alt: Definition of young modulus
    
    Schematic of Young Modulus definition. F, force applied to sample, S
    surface of cross section when uncompressed, :math:`L_0`, length when no load
    applied. For both compression and extension, in the regime of small
    deformation, the relative change of length is proportional to the applied
    force. Here, the material can be seen to expand/contract in the direction
    orthogonal to the direction of application of the force, in the case of an
    incompressible material (:math:`\nu \neq 0.5`) this con be seen as the
    conservation of volume of the material.

The shear modulus is defined for a deformation parallel to the surface on which it is applied :

.. math::

   G &= \frac{\tau_{xy}}{\gamma_{xy}} \\
      & = \frac{   F/S }{   \Delta x / l        }


.. figure:: /figs/shearm.png
    :width: 50%

    Schematic of deformation for the shear modulus.


A number of other characteristic number can be defined for material, in the
case of isotropic elastic material, only two of those parameter are enough to
completely define the properties of the material. 


Poisson Ratio
=============
.. 3

We have just seen that the shear modulus is linked to the Young modulus using
the Poisson ratio.  The Poisson ration is another characteristic of a material
that define how much a material will compress/expand in the directions
orthogonal to its elongation.

Having volume conservation of material during compression or elongation require
a Poisson ratio of `0.5`. Such value have been found in bulk measurement of
actin network :cite:`Gardel2003`. Material with a Poisson ratio of `0.5` are
said to be incompressible. A Poisson ratio lower `0.5` correspond to material
expanding less than incompressible materials, some cell ad tissues are known to
have Poisson ratio lower than 0.5 :cite:`Mahaffy2004`. Another critical value
is 0, at which the material only expand or contract in the direction of the
main stress.Material with a Poisson ratio superior to 0.5 would show a bigger
deformation in the orthogonal direction than incompressible material, leading
to a global increase of volume if compressed. 


Viscosity
=========
.. 3

Like elasticity, viscosity is something tangible we are used to work with in
everyday life, the more viscous a material is the more difficult it is to move
something in it at high speed. And indeed, viscosity is the pendant of Elastic
modulus but when considering force induced by speed instead of displacement.
The force exerted by the gradient a velocity, on a surface `S`  orthogonal to
direction :math:`\vec z` will be written :

.. math::

    F = \eta \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}

Where :math:`\eta` is the viscosity, and is expressed in :math:`Pa.s`.

.. We will
.. also note that viscosity is often written :math:`\mu`, and can
.. also while dividing by the fluid density (:math:`\rho`)  then being :math:`\nu = {\eta}/{\rho}`.

At room temperature water have a viscosity of around 1 mPa.s, an honey have a
viscosity of around 10 Pa.s. The consideration of viscosity in problems will
often depend on the timescale at which the problem is considers, where at short
timescale tissues will behave elastically, whereas at long timescale the effect
of viscosity will be seen :cite:`Thoumine1997`. In actin network, the effect of
viscosity at short time scale can be as high as elasticity :cite:`Gardel`. 


.. todo:

    Relatively short, compare to E/G but for speed, value of viscosity for
    different fluid ?  Quick reynolds equation ? In the condition we are interested
    in we are at extremely low reynolds, so no intertia involved ?

.. todo:

    some value for tissues. Existence of  negative PR
    material we put everything in G, make it complex define the real and imaginary
    part as G' g'' 

Viscoelastic
============
.. 3

Typically, no material is purely elastic or purely viscous. When glacier can
seem purely solid at the time scale of a few days, observation on longer time
scale ranging from month to years will convince you that ice is not only a
solid but can also flow. Of course water in its solid form is not the only
material which is both solid and viscous. In order to describe the such
behavior one need the theory of viscoelastic materials.  Number of models have
been and are still developed to describe viscoelastic behavior. The
Kelvin-Voight and Maxwell models are two of the simpler one. A thought
experiment to understand each of these model is to put a spring and a dash pot
in parallel or series.  The model system will have a viscoelastic behavior. 


.. figure:: /figs/MKV.png
    :width: 70%    

    Maxwell model schematic on the right and Kelvin-Voight model on the right.
    Both are a simple approach to express the properties of a viscoelastic
    model. The response to a creep compliance will differ in both case. Maxwell
    model will mostly behave like  a fluid with viscosity :math:`\eta` after a
    long time, where the Kelvin-Voight model will mostly reflect the elastic
    component at constant stress exerted. (Schematic in Public Domain, adapted
    from Wikimedia).

The idea for more complex models is the same, any material can be seen like an
(infinite) combination of springs (for elasticity), and dash-pot, (for viscosity).

The generalised model can then be described using a unique parameter, we extend
the shear modulus with a imaginary part (becoming :math:`G^*`), thus capturing the effect of
viscosity. In addition to an imaginary part, we introduce a dependency of `G`
with a pulsation (:math:`\omega`).

The real and imaginary part of :math:`G^*` are respectively called storage
(:math:`G'`) and loss (:math:`G"`) modulus.  We can then write the following :
   
.. math::
    G^*(\omega) = G' (\omega) + i.G"(\omega)

Where :math:`i` is the imaginary unit.  The star denoting the complex character
of `G` can be dropped, as well as the explicit dependency with :math:`\omega`.
The viscoelastic properties of a material are fully characterized by the full
expression for the storage and loss modulus as a function of the frequencies.

Models for actin network of different concentration under different hypotheses
have been extensively studied, and exhibit characteristic behavior for linear :cite:`Morse1998a`, and non linear :cite:`Yao2011` regimes.

Optical tweezer
***************
.. 2

Optical tweezer, or optical trap are a technique that allow to trap object near
the focal plane of microscope at the point where a high power laser is focused.
It is a versatile technique that allow to trap both fabricated object and part
of living cell an apply force up to a few tenth of pico newtons and detect
displacement of a few hundreds of nanometers.

To understand that light can trap an object, you should keep in mind that
despite having no mass, light carry momentum, and as for any massive object,
changing the trajectory require applying a force and this object. According to
newton third law, if you apply a force on an object, the object exerted the
opposite force. This will lead to object with higher refractive index being
attracted by toward higher light intensity. In a parallel laser beam, with a Gaussian
intensity profile, this will lead to  the object being attracted toward the
center of the beam. 

In addition to the lateral trapping, if the laser beam is focuses, this lead to
another weaker intensity gradient along the direction of propagation of the
beam, the intensity being at its highest at the laser waist. 

A focused laser inside a laser into the microscope's objective then act as a
three dimensional potential that keeps particle like hold in a tweezer. Usually
the trapping in the observation plane is strong, while the stiffness of the
trap in the direction of illumination is weak.

It should be noted that if trapped particles are hold strongly near the laser
focus, this does prevent the laser from exerting force on surrounding
particles, usually slowly attracting floating object passing in the converging
beam of light toward the plane of observation. The light also having a non
negligible radiation  pressure, object in the second half cone of diverging
light beyond the observation plane are often repel away from the trap.

    Deflected light by a transparent bead change the momentum of light, so the

    the high intensity.  For a focused laser beam, the bead will be attracted
    near the focus of the laser.


In addition to allowing the object, to be hold in place, optical trap have the
advantaged of allowing the high frequency measurement of the force exerted on a
object as a function of time, though careful calibration of the trap is
necessary, and different methods can be used to do such calibration
:cite:`Jahnel2011`, :cite:`Vermeulen2006`. Indeed, as we saw previously, when
the trapped particle is not in the trap center it though exert a force on the
light beam, though slightly deflecting the light beam. Using optics and lenses
correctly placed on the Fourier plane of the sample, it is hence possible to
translate this change of orientation of the light  beam into a displacement of
a light spot onto a photo detector with hight sensitivity to displacement.

One of the quality of optical trap is that it often allow the multiplication of
the number of trap. A simple method allowing the obtainment of two trap is to
split the incoming light into two orthogonally polarized independent beam.
Instead of sharing the laser power between the different trap using
polarisation, one can use what is known as time sharing. By switching the laser
rapidly between traps at a much faster time scale than the relevant time scale
of the experiment, one is able to virtually achieve multiple traps on the same
sample.

In our case, the rapid switching is achieved using Accousto Optic Deflector
(aka AODs).  ADO consists of a crystal in which propagate a high frequency
sound-wave. The passing of the sound wave generate local change in the
refractive index of the material which then act as a diffracting grating. In
the right condition, the trapping laser passing through the same crystal will
then be deflected by generated grating.

In practice, rapidly controlling the frequency and amplitude of the generated
wave into the crystal, allow direct adjustment of laser position of the trap
position. Using AOD also have the advantage of allowing control not only of
number and position of multiple traps, but also the individual power allocated
to each trap and though stiffness of relevant trap.

    A schematic of used setup. The following element can be distinguished. An
    1064nm Laser will be used for trapping, it first pass through two AODs that
    well respectively be responsible from moving the position of the trap in
    the X ad Y direction.  The first couple of lenses between AODs are
    responsible from having both AOD conjugated.  The second pair of lens will
    allow to steer the beam and make sure that the AODs are  conjugated with
    the back-focal plane of the first objective, putting then in the Fourier
    plane of the sample. Thus a change of angle of the light beam induce by the
    AOD in reflected into the objective by a change of position of the trap.
    The trapping light is collected by a second objective, converging on a
    Quadrant photodiode (QPD) conjugated with the back focal plane of the
    collecting objective. By construction QPD and AODs should be conjugated, so
    deviation of the light beam induced by one of the AODs is not supposed to
    induce any change of position of the laser spot on the QPD. Additional
    dichroics mirror allow to use bright field and epifluorescence at the same
    time than using optical tweezer.

Determination of force and displacement on bead
===============================================
.. 3

Using optical tweezer to not only hold a particle in position, but also get
quantitative measurement of its displacement and force exerted require
calibrated probe. The use of polystyrene beads is one of the artificial probe
that can be use to achieve such a goal.

The use of polystyrene bead has multiple advantages, the first being that one
can obtain mono-dispersed bead leading to reproducible and predictable trap
stiffness. Secondly theory  can predict the shape of
the potential felt by such a bead in a Gaussian beam :cite:`Nieminen2007`.

    Left : scheme representing the potential felt by a bead along one axis,
    near the minimum of the potential it can be approximated as an harmonic
    potential, which correspond to a constant stiffness. Right: Deflection of
    the light by an off centered bead in the trap. Also proportional to the
    displacement of the spot on the QPD. With correct calibration of the trap
    the displacement is also proportional the force exerted on the bead.
    
The second advantage being that beads can be functionalized, allowing specific
interaction to be controlled, both in vitro and in vivo. Of course, the
calibration is essential for the correct measurement of mechanical property of
different system, and the choice of the bead diameter have impact both on
biological side and in the physics of the measurement. In particular, the
linear regime for the  displacement-deflection can only be seen for beads that have a
diameter which is not too close from the beam waist diameter. In such case a
flattening on the curve prevent precise measurement.

Oocyte division
***************
.. 2

Oocyte are female germinal cell in the process of gametogenesis. Unlike somatic
cell that undergoes symmetric division via mitosis  which will lead to two
identical cells sharing the same genetic material, oocyte undergo a different
process called meiosis.  Meiosis in oocyte is a highly asymmetric process
necessary for the specificity of the oocyte which are large haploid cells.

The exact process of formation of oocyte can vary among species, we will
describe the main mechanisms.

The complete process of egg maturation start with Primordial germ cell which
will undergo mitosis to replicate until it enter the first meiosis (Meiosis I)
at which state it is now called Primary oocyte and is still diploid. 

The primary oocyte will start maturation and growth, then undergo a first
asymmetric division just after prophase I.  This first division is asymmetric
both in  the genetic material separation and in the unequal size of the formed
daughter cell. Indeed, the primary oocyte will divide into a secondary oocyte
and a polar body. Both secondary oocyte and polar body are haploid and contain
only half of the genetic material of the primary oocyte.  The secondary oocyte
can go through Meiosis II in which it incur a second asymmetric division
expulsion a second polar body. The polar bodies will eventually degenerate.

During meiosis, the process of cell division also differ from mitosis. Instead
of separating into two identically sized cell through the formation of a
cytokinetic ring, the primary oocyte will become the secondary oocyte by
expulsion a polar body. The formation expulsion of the polar body require
precise positioning of the cells organelles. During prophase I the nucleus of
oocyte is carefully centered, undergo nuclear breakdown and formation of
spindle. The first meiotic spindle will migrate toward the oocyte cortex along
its major axis. Once at the cortex half of the genetic material of the spindle
will be exposed through the membrane forming the first polar body of much
smaller size than second oocyte.

    Asymmetric division of oocyte into polar bodies. The Primary oocyte
    asymmetrically divide into a secondary oocyte and a smaller polar body each
    containing half the DNA of the mother cell. The secondary oocyte will
    divide asymmetrically a second time to become the mature ovum while
    expulsion a polar body. This asymmetric division process allow the
    formation of a large haploid cell. Adapted from Wikipedia – Gray's
