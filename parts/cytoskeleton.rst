Cytoskeleton
************


    cf  fletcher 2010 review :cite:`Fletcher2010` the cytoskeletton as 3 main functions :
        - organize cell in space
        - connect cell to external environement (bichem and mechanical) 
        - generate and coordinate force to allow cell to change shape.
        - some things on temporal and spacial effect of structures like "bud scar"
        - schema of branched arp2/3 actin factor

    - more than150 protein have been found to bind with actin.
    - Wave complex, 
      - Wasp, N-Wasp ( need to cite `Machesky1999` )
    - Not composed only by actin

    should cite `Pollard2003`

    - Some network need actin, some other do not. (Fletcher review 2010)

    - NPF
    - Polymerase, (depolymerase severing), crosslinker, stabilizing
    - Moleular motors.
    - interphase, cellule prepare for division
    - Mitosis : "DNA Segregating"

    - need to describe actin, 
    - polymerisation barbed end pointed end, (directed)
      - form microfilement
    - cytoskeleton is dynamic
    - formed under the plasme membrane
    - ratchet nechanisme
    - use of Arp2/3 to branch
    - capping, protein,  formin (OOcyte)
    - myosin, run on actin to barbed end/ processive/not processive.
      - stress fibres
    - troppomyosine
    - phaloidine
