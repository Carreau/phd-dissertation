Cytoskeleton
============


    - need to describe actin, 
    - polymerisation barbed end pointed end, (directed)
      - form microfilement
    - formed under the plasme membrane
    - ratchet nechanisme
    - use of Arp2/3 to branch
    - capping, protein,  formin (OOcyte)
    - myosin, run on actin to barbed end/ processive/not processive.
      - stress fibres
