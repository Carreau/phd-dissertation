- give a standard size for a cell.

Cells are the smallest living component which are present from unicellular
plants to multicellular animals. Thus, cells should cover a huge range of
behavior going from extremely specific on multicellular organism, to all the
function that are needed to survive and reproduce for bacterial colony.
Multicellular organism will grow specialized cell from neurone — for example
responsible from propagating the electric signal along nerves — that grow on
soft material, to osteoblast growing on stiff substrate and responsible to
generate bone materials, going through germinal cells allowing the organism to
reproduce. In the other hand, unicellular organisms are made of cell that are
responsible for all the function of the organism, from motility to
reproduction, passing through absorption of nutriment to replication of the
cell.


Cell are hence able to adapt to their environment as a function of time, and
also have function and behavior that depends on time, and a small change of
timing and/or biochemical conditions can highly injure the development of an
organism :cite:`things on starfishes`.

Nonetheless, even with all theses different behavior and phenotype, the cells
all have a common structure. They are constituted by a membrane which is
responsible form separating the cytoplasm from the outside of the cell. The
cytoplasm contains organelles, genetic material, and lots of proteins that the
cell use to accomplish its functions. Cells are of course not completely
isolated, and have numbers of mechanism to exchange and communicate with the
outside. Communication with the outside can be with chemical signal, hence
cells have developed way of transporting or detecting proteins and ions through
it's membrane. But it also need to change its mechanics. To do so, cells can
for example change there osmotic pressure by varying their osmotic pressure,
but can also exert and feel force through the membrane. Cross membrane
proteins, named integrins are made to do so, but need a structure on the inside
of the cell that can support the forces transmitted by integrins. 

This structure, which is situated just below the cell membrane, is named the actin cortex, 


  All the living kingdom is characterised by the fact that organism can reproduce,
And

Cell Motility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. general_motility

Wether cells are part of multicellular or uni-cellular organism, they should
be able to move in their environment Usually, cell movement is differentiated
in two categories: when cells are placed on a two dimensional environment
— which is often the case for epidermal cells, or a culture cells –, or a three
dimensional environment.

.. 2D_motility

Motility on a  two dimensional environment is called reptation. To move by
reptation. Cells need to be spread on the surface, in the front of the cell can
be seen a lamelipodia, a thin and wide protrusion of the cell that will
progress forward, then the rear of the cell will detach, making the centroid of
cell change position. On the edge of the lamelipodia is present tubular
protrusion that will go father than the leading edge of the lamelipodia, attach
to the surface.

Cell Division
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We saw that cell phenotype was changing as a function of time.  In
particular, cell divide to and grow. The mechanism of cell division can be
quite different depending on the type of dividing cells. Bacteria, for
example, will replicate identically, giving birth to two identical daughter
cells. Somatic cells of most multicellular organism, will also divide
symmetrically leading to 2 daughter cells having the same genetic material,
than the mother cell.  On the other hand, Mouse OOcyte, will at some point
of their maturation — Meiosis — divide asymmetrically two time in a row,
leading to a mature OOcyte and 3 polar body.


    Mitosis in normal cell, 

    - cell detach from surface,
    - rounds up 
    - nucleus center
    - nuclear breakdown 
    - chromosome forms, 
    - actin pack chromosome, 
    - microtubule fetch chromosome 
    - spindel form and migrate to the centrosome, 
    - cytokinetic actin ring contract. 


Cell Organelle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Mitoncondria, ER (made to produce proteins), also serve in lacust
    - nucleus en eucariotes cells, contains the chromosomes.
    - Nucleus get moved by actin filement to the periclinal/anticlinal wall, 
    - centromere centriole, 
    - Organelles are supported by 


Description of cell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Unit of all living things
    - Move, divide, react to their environment, differentiate
    - divide

      - spherical, cytokinetic ring, filopodia
      - how force effect actin

    - focal adhesion
    - that was mostly all of what was internal<-> external interaction there are also inner cell effect :
    - organelle, 

      - nucleus/spindle positioning in division
      - from OOcyte, diploid -> haploid
      - Movement nucleus to periclinal/anticlinal wall away from UV. 
      - translocation in locust


We can see in plants that actin, also known as microfilement :cite:`Iwabuchi2010` is used to move nucleus away from
