Cell are the basic building block of life, all living things are composed of
cells, from unicellular to multicellular organisms like us. Unicellular
organism must accomplish all the functions relative to cell life. At the other end,
multicellular organism cells differentiate in order to accomplish specialised
tasks often by regrouping into organs. Despite sharing the same genetic
material, each cell to accomplish a different task require different
mechanical properties. The variation of elasticity and other
mechanical properties of cells derive from the structure they are composed of.

    This paragraph is a little too repetitive try to boil it down to 1-3 simple
    phrases rethink what message you want transmit.

Cells are hence able to adapt to their environment and develop function and
behavior that will depend on time. A small change of timing and/or biochemical
conditions can highly injure the development of an organism : modification of
the actin network at the right time of the cell cycle prevents symmetric division
:cite:`Lenart2005`, :cite:`Vasilev2012`. Mechanical properties of the substrate can
govern the differentiation of cells : Soft substrate will favor brain-tissue
cell, where stiff substrates increase the appearance of muscle cells
:cite:`Engler2006`.


Nonetheless, even with all theses different behavior and phenotypes, cells
have a common structure. The exterior of the cell is separated from the
inside by a plasma membrane. The interior of the cell is filled with the cytoplasm
which contain diverse structures known as organelles, genetic material, and
a large number of proteins that the cell uses to accomplish its functions. To
communicate with the outside, cells have a series of mechanism that allow signals
and cargo to go through the membrane. This communication can be chemical, but
mechanics is also known to participate in the process. To sense their
mechanical environment, cells use adhesion complexes to attach to the
substrate, and integrins as trans-membrane protein to transfer the force to the
cell cytoskeleton situated inside the cell. Chemical signals can either cross
the membrane through trans-membrane proteins, endocytosis and exocytosis are
ways for the cell to impart and export proteins and chemicals through its membrane.

Oocyte
******
.. 2

A particular type of cell I was interested in during my PhD is mouse oocyte.
Oocyte are female germinal cells in the process of gametogenesis. Unlike
somatic cells that undergoes symmetric division via mitosis  which will lead to
two identical cells sharing the same genetic material, oocytes undergo a
different process called meiosis.  Meiosis in oocytes is a highly asymmetric
process necessary for the specificity of the oocytes which are large haploid
cells, containing at the end of the meiosis only one chromosome of each pair
that constitutes the genetic material of a mouse. The second chromosome of each pair
will be provided by the fertilisation of the oocyte by the male.

The exact process of formation of oocyte can vary among species, we will
describe the main mechanisms.

The complete process of egg maturation start with Primordial germ cell which
will undergo mitosis to replicate until it enter the first meiosis (Meiosis I)
at which state it is now called Primary oocyte and is still diploid, that is to say still contains the two chromosomes of each pairs. 

The primary oocyte will start maturation and growth, then undergo a first
asymmetric division just after prophase I.  This first division is asymmetric
both in  the genetic material separation and in the unequal size of the formed
daughter cell. Indeed, the primary oocyte will divide into a secondary oocyte
and a polar body. Both secondary oocyte and polar body are haploid and contain
only half of the genetic material of the primary oocyte.  The secondary oocyte
can go through Meiosis II in which it incur a second asymmetric division
expulsion a second polar body. The polar bodies will eventually degenerate
(:num:`Fig #fig-asymetric-division`).

During meiosis, the process of cell division also differ from mitosis. Instead
of separating into two identically sized cell through the formation of a
cytokinetic ring, the primary oocyte will become the secondary oocyte by
expulsion a polar body. The formation expulsion of the polar body require
precise positioning of the cells organelles. During prophase I the nucleus of
oocyte is carefully centered, undergo nuclear breakdown and formation of
spindle. The first meiotic spindle will migrate toward the oocyte cortex along
its major axis. Once at the cortex half of the genetic material of the spindle
will be exposed through the membrane forming the first polar body of much
smaller size than second oocyte.

Mouse oocyte are good model system for study of mechanical properties inside
cells, indeed,  they form big spherical cells with a diameter of around 80 µm
which allows study of mechanical properties of cell at different location in
the cytoplasm.

In the third part of my PhD I participated in a collaboration with Marie-Hélene
Verhlac and Maria Almonacid at Collège de France who are interested of the
effect of actin dynamics in oocyte cytoplasm during the different part of the
oocyte gametogenesis.

    Asymmetric division of oocyte into polar bodies. The Primary oocyte
    asymmetrically divide into a secondary oocyte and a smaller polar body each
    containing half the DNA of the mother cell. The secondary oocyte will
    divide asymmetrically a second time to become the mature ovum while
    expulsion a polar body. This asymmetric division process allow the
    formation of a large haploid cell. Adapted from Wikipedia – Gray's

Cell Organelles
===============
.. 3

Inside the cytoplasm, cells have a number of structures with different and
specialised functions which are called organelles. The position and state of
organelles is of great importance for the cell to achieve its functions.
Probably the most known organelle is the cell nucleus of eukariotic cells that
contains the genetic material. Attached to the nucleus is the endoplasmic
reticulum  which is the organelle responsible form translating
RNA coming from the nucleus to functional proteins that will be delivered
across the cell after maturation in vesicles. Theses vesicles are
transported across the cell both by dyneins and kinesins — molecular motors —
that walk along microtubules originating from the centriole part of the
centrosome but also by myosin along actin filaments.  All of those processes
consume energy in  the form of ATP, generated within the mitocondria spread
across the cytoplasm. A schematic of the cell with some organelles can be seen
on :num:`figure #albertcell`

    Schematic of an eukariotic cell, adapted from :cite:`Alberts2008`. One can
    see the many component that constitute majority of cells.  Cell shape and
    size can highly vary, from quasi spherical with a typical size of ten
    micrometers to elongated neurones that can be tens of centimeters long.


The positioning of organelles is crucial for the life of an organism. During the
meiotic division of cell, for example, it has been seen that the positioning of
the nucleus at the center of the cell in mouse oocytes happens before its
migration closer to the cortex to expel the first polar body. Failure to do so
result in a incorrect amount of DNA in germinal cell that can lead to
infertility. 

It is already known that microtubules play a key role in organelle positioning.
Microtubules emanating from centrosome position at the two ends of the cell
during its division is used to fetch the correct chromosomes. Each
chromosome is pulled towards the centrosome which leads to each daughter
cell having the same amount of DNA.

Actin plays also an determinant role in organelle positioning process,
like in drosophila oocyte maturation where it positions the nurses cell away
from the dumping canal :cite:`Huelsmann2013`. In a later chapter (:ref:`Organelle
Positionning <organelle_positioning>`) we will develop a few keys points where
actin is indispensable in organelle positioning and how this relate to the
biomimetic actin networks we reconstitute.

The Cytoskeleton
================
.. 3

The cytoskeleton, literally skeleton of the cell, is the structure which gives
it shape to a cell.  As for other multicellular animals that possesses
skeleton, its shape is often a hint on how a organism moves. As feet, fins and
wings are characteristics that will tell you whether a animal 
prefer land, see or air, the cytoskeleton will tell you many
things a bout a cell. 

Unlike the (exo)-skeleton of animals which is rigid and
static, the cytoskeleton of cell is a  highly dynamic structure that keep
remodeling itself on a short time scale compared to the speed at which a cell
moves. Thanks to this dynamics cytoskeleton can achieve its
functions.  As vertebrates skeletons are necessary to transmit force from one part
of the body to another, the cytoskeleton is responsible to not only
transmit the forces the cell is exerting, but also to generate theses force.
The cytoskeleton connect a cell to its environment,
both mechanically and biochemically.

We will consecrate a longer part of this work to describe the cytoskeleton.
