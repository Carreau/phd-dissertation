Cell are the basic building block of life, all living are composed of cells,
from unicellular organism to multicellular organism like us. When in
unicellular organism the unique cell must accomplish all the organism
functions. In a multicellular organism cell are able to differentiate in order
to accomplish specialised task  often regrouped into organs, and each of these
different task require different properties from the cells.

    This paragraph is a little too repetitive try to boil it down to 1-3 simple
    phrases rethink what message you want transmit.

Cell are hence able to adapt to their environment and develop 
function and behavior that will depends on time. A small change of
timing and/or biochemical conditions can highly injure the development of an
organism :cite:`Lenart2005`, it has also been observe that the mechanical
properties of substrate can govern the differentiation of cell
:cite:`Engler2006` .

Nonetheless, even with all theses different behavior and phenotype, the cells
all have a common structure. They are constituted by a membrane which is
responsible form separating the cytoplasm from the outside of the cell. The
cytoplasm contains organelles, genetic material, and large number of proteins
that the cell uses to accomplish its functions. Cells are of course not
completely isolated, and have a series of mechanisms to exchange and
communicate with the outside. This communication can be chemical but  mechanics
is also known to participate in the process. To sense their mechanical
environment, cells use adhesion complexes to attach to the substrate, and integrins
as trans-membrane protein to transfer the force to the cell cytoskeleton
situated inside the cell.

The Cell Cytoskeleton
=====================
.. 3

The cytoskeleton, literally skeleton of the cell, is the structure which give
it shape to a cell.  As for other multicellular animals that possesses
skeleton, its shape is often a hint on how a organism move. As feet, fins and
wigs are characteristics that will tell you whether a animal does more
preferably prefer land, see or air, the cytoskeleton is will tell you many
things a bout a cell. 

In the other hand, unlike (exo)-Skeleton of animals which is ridged and
unchanging, the cytoskeleton of cell is a  highly dynamic structure that keep
remodeling itself on a short time scale compared to the speed at which a cell
move. That's through this dynamics that the cytoskeleton can achieve its
functions.  As mammals skeletons are necessary to transmit force from one part
of the body to another, the cell cytoskeleton is responsible to not only
transmit the force the cell is exerting, but also to generate theses force.
Thats through its cytoskeleton that a cell can be connected to its environment,
both mechanically and biochemically.

We will consecrate a longer part to describe the cytoskeleton later :ref:`role_of_actin`

Cell Organelles
===============

.. todo:: 

    Maybe this should be before cytoskeleton. Here it is breaking the flow.
    Also you may ------ -- ti 12. when you introduce the cell

Beyond the membrane, cytoplasm and cytoskeleton, cells have a number of
structures with different and specialised functions. The position and state of
each of theses structure is of great importance for the cell to achieve its
function. Probably the most known organelle is the cell nucleus of eukariotic
cells that contains the genetic material of the cell. Attached to the nucleus
is the endoplasmic reticulum (also know as ER) which is the organelle
responsible form translating RNA coming from the nucleus into functional
proteins that will be delivered across the cell after maturation through
vesicles. Theses vesicles are transported across the cell both by dyneins and
kinesins that walks along microtubules originating from the centriole part of
the centrosome but also by myosin along actin filaments . All of those process
consume energy as the form of ATP, generated from with the mitocondrion spread
across the cytoplasm.

The positioning of organelle is crucial for the life of an organism.  During
meiotic division of cell, for example, it has been seen that the positioning of
the nucleus at the center of the cell in mouse oocyte happen before its
migration closer to the cortex to expel the first polar body.  Failure to do so
result in a incorrect amount of DNA in germinal cell that can lead to
infertility.


.. todo::

    Maybe mention that actin  is important in this positioning.


Same goes with the centrosome which positions at two opposite points in the cell
when it starts to divide. Microtubules emanating from theses centriole will be
used to fetch the correct chromosomes and pull them to each of the centrosome
to get the same amount of DNA into each of the daughter cells.

The position of the organelles can have more unexpected effects. In particular,
some nocturnal locust adapt their vision depending on the light condition by
modifying the properties of a part of their eye called the omatidium.  More
specially, the refractive index if each organelle being slightly different, the
reorganisation of the position on mitocondrion and endoplasmic reticulum inside
the cell has been show to be droved by actin polymerisation and responsible
from changed in optical properties in locust eye :cite:`Sturmer1995`.


Movement of organelles is also crucial for plant biology, indeed, genetic
material is sensitive to UV light, and protecting it is necessary for plant
survival. Iwabuchi et al. have show that actin is responsible for the migration
of the cell nucleus away from the part of the cell the more exposed to the
damaging light :cite:`Iwabuchi2010`.
