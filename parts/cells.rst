Cells are the basic building blocks of life, and all living beings are composed of
cells, from unicellular up to multicellular organisms like us. Unicellular
organisms must accomplish all their functions within a single cell. At the other end,
in multicellular organisms cells differentiate in order to accomplish specialised
tasks often by regrouping into organs. Despite sharing the same genetic
material, for each cell to accomplish a different task often requires different
mechanical properties. The variation of elasticity and other
mechanical properties of cells derive from the structure they are composed of.

    This paragraph is a little too repetitive try to boil it down to 1-3 simple
    phrases rethink what message you want transmit.

Cells are hence able to adapt to their environment and develop functions and
behavior that may change over time. A small change of timing and/or biochemical
conditions can highly injure the development of an organism: for example modification of
the actin network at a given time during the cell cycle prevents symmetric division
:cite:`Lenart2005`, :cite:`Vasilev2012`. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the substrate can
govern the differentiation of cells: Soft substrate will favor brain-tissue
cell, where stiff substrates increase the appearance of muscle cells
:cite:`Engler2006`.


Nonetheless, even with all theses different behavior and phenotypes, cells
have a common structure. The exterior of the cell is separated from the
inside by a plasma membrane. The interior of the cell is filled with the cytoplasm
which contains diverse structures such as organelles, genetic material, and
a large number of proteins that the cell uses to accomplish its functions. To
communicate with the outside, cells have a series of mechanisms that allow signals
and cargo to pass the membrane. This communication can be chemical, but
mechanics is also known to participate in the process. To sense their
mechanical environment, cells often use adhesion complexes to attach to the
substrate, and integrins as trans-membrane protein to transfer the force to the
cell cytoskeleton situated inside the cell. Chemical signals can either cross
the membrane through trans-membrane proteins, while endocytosis and exocytosis are
ways for the cell to import and export proteins and chemicals through its membrane.

Oocyte
******
.. 2

A particular cell type I was interested in during my PhD are mouse oocytes.
Oocytes are female germinal cells in the process of gametogenesis. Unlike
somatic cells that undergoes symmetric division via mitosis which leads to
two identical cells sharing the same genetic material, oocytes undergo a
different process called meiosis.  Meiosis in oocytes is a highly asymmetric
process necessary for the specificity of being large haploid
cells, containing at the end of meiosis only one chromosome of each pair
that constitutes the genetic material of a mouse. The second chromosome of each pair
will be provided during fertilisation of the oocyte by the male sperm.

The exact process of oocyte formation can vary among species, and in the following we will
describe the main mechanisms.

The complete process of egg maturation starts with primordial germ cells that
undergo mitosis to replicate until they enter the first meiosis (Meiosis I)
at which state they are called primary oocytes and are still diploid, that is to say still contains two chromosomes of each pair. 

The primary oocyte will start maturation and growth and then undergo a first
asymmetric division just after prophase I.  This first division is asymmetric
both in the genetic material separation and in the unequal size of the formed
daughter cell. Indeed, the primary oocyte will divide into a secondary oocyte
and a polar body. Both, the secondary oocyte and the polar body are haploid and contain
only half of the genetic material of the primary oocyte.  The secondary oocyte
can go through Meiosis II in which it undergoes a second asymmetric division
and expulsion of a second polar body. These polar bodies will eventually degenerate
(:num:`Fig #fig-asymetric-division`).

During meiosis, the process of cell division also differ from mitosis. Instead
of separating into two identically sized cells through the formation of a
cytokinetic ring, the primary oocyte will become the secondary oocyte by
expulsion a polar body. The formation expulsion of the polar body require
precise positioning of the cell organelles. During prophase I the nucleus of
the oocyte is carefully centered, undergoes a nuclear breakdown and spindle formation.
The first meiotic spindle will migrate toward the oocyte cortex along
its major axis. Once at the cortex, half of the genetic material of the spindle
will be expelled through the membrane forming the first polar body of much
smaller size than second oocyte.

Mouse oocyte are good model systems to study the mechanical properties inside
cells. They form big spherical cells with a diameter of around 80 µm
which allow to study the mechanical properties at different locations in
the cytoplasm.

In the third part of my PhD I participated in a collaboration with Marie-Hélène
Verlhac and Maria Almonacid at Collège de France who are interested in the
effect of actin dynamics in oocyte cytoplasm during the different parts of
oocyte gametogenesis.

    Asymmetric division of oocytes into polar bodies. The primary oocyte
    asymmetrically divide into a secondary oocyte and a smaller polar body each
    containing half the DNA of the mother cell. The secondary oocyte will
    divide asymmetrically a second time to become the mature ovum while
    expelling a polar body. This asymmetric division process allow the
    formation of a large haploid cell. Adapted from Wikipedia – Gray's

Cell Organelles
===============
.. 3

Inside the cytoplasm, cells have a number of structures with different and
specialised functions which are called organelles. The position and state of
organelles is of great importance for the cell to achieve its functions.
Probably the most known organelle is the cell nucleus of eukariotic cells that
contains the genetic material. Attached to the nucleus is the endoplasmic
reticulum  which is the organelle responsible for translating
RNA coming from the nucleus to functional proteins that will be delivered
across the cell after maturation in vesicles. Theses vesicles are
transported across the cell both by dyneins and kinesins — molecular motors —
that walk along microtubules originating from the centriole part of the
centrosome but also by myosins walking along actin filaments.  All of those processes
consume energy in  the form of ATP, generated within the mitocondria spread
across the cytoplasm. A schematic of the cell with some organelles can be seen
on :num:`figure #albertcell`

    Schematic of an eukariotic cell, adapted from :cite:`Alberts2008`. Visualized are
    the many components that constitute the majority of cells.  Cell shape and
    size can highly vary, from quasi spherical with a typical size of ten
    micrometers to elongated neurones that can be tens of centimeters long.


The positioning of organelles is crucial for the life of the cell. During
meiotic division of cells, for example, it has been seen that the positioning of
the nucleus at the center of mouse oocytes happens before its
migration closer to the cortex to expel the first polar body. Failure to do so
results in a incorrect amount of DNA in germinal cell that can lead to
infertility. 

It is already known that microtubules play a key role in organelle positioning.
Microtubules emanating from centrosome position at the two ends of the cell
during its division are used to fetch the correct chromosomes. Each
chromosome is pulled towards the centrosome which leads to each daughter
cell having the same amount of DNA.

Actin plays also an determinant role in organelle positioning process,
like in drosophila oocyte maturation where it positions the nurses cell away
from the dumping canal :cite:`Huelsmann2013`. In a later chapter (:ref:`Organelle
Positioning <organelle_positioning>`) we will develop a few keys points where
actin is indispensable in organelle positioning and how this relate to the
biomimetic actin networks we reconstitute.

The Cytoskeleton
================
.. 3

The cytoskeleton, literally skeleton of the cell, is the structure which gives
the shape to a cell.  As for other multicellular animals that posses
skeleton, its shape is often a hint on how an organism moves. As feet, fins and
wings are characteristics that will tell you whether a animal 
prefer land, see or air, the cytoskeleton will tell you many
things about a cell. 

Unlike the (exo)-skeleton of animals which is rigid and
static, the cytoskeleton of cell is a  highly dynamic structure that keeps
remodeling itself on a short time scale compared to the speed at which a cells
move. Thanks to these dynamics, the cytoskeleton can achieve its
functions.  As vertebrates skeletons are necessary to transmit force from one part
of the body to another, the cytoskeleton is responsible not only to
transmit the forces the cell is exerting, but also to generate theses forces.
The cytoskeleton connect a cell to its environment,
both mechanically and biochemically.

We will consecrate a longer part of this work to describe the cytoskeleton.
