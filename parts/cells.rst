Cell are the basic building block of life, all living are composed of cells,
from unicellular organism to multicellular organism like us. When in
unicellular organism the unique cell must accomplish all the organism
functions. In a multicellular organism cell are able to differentiate in order
to accomplish specialised task  often regrouped into organs, and each of these
different task require different properties from the cells.

.. todo::

    This paragraph is a little too repetitive try to boil it down to 1-3 simple
    phrases rethink what message you want transmit.

Cell are hence able to adapt to their environment and develop 
function and behavior that will depends on time. A small change of
timing and/or biochemical conditions can highly injure the development of an
organism :cite:`Lenart2005`, it has also been observe that the mechanical
properties of substrate can govern the differentiation of cell
:cite:`Engler2006` .

Nonetheless, even with all theses different behavior and phenotype, the cells
all have a common structure. They are constituted by a membrane which is
responsible form separating the cytoplasm from the outside of the cell. The
cytoplasm contains organelles, genetic material, and large number of proteins
that the cell uses to accomplish its functions. Cells are of course not
completely isolated, and have a series of mechanisms to exchange and
communicate with the outside. This communication can be chemical but  mechanics
is also known to participate in the process. To sense their mechanical
environment, cells use adhesion complexes to attach to the substrate, and integrins
as trans-membrane protein to transfer the force to the cell cytoskeleton
situated inside the cell.

The Cell Cytoskeleton
=====================

The cytoskeleton, literally skeleton of the cell, is the structure which give
it shape to a cell.  As for other multicellular animals that possesses
skeleton, its shape is often a hint on how a organism move. As feet, fins and
wigs are characteristics that will tell you whether a animal does more
preferably prefer land, see or air, the cytoskeleton is will tell you many
things a bout a cell. 

In the other hand, unlike (exo)-Skeleton of animals which is ridged and
unchanging, the cytoskeleton of cell is a  highly dynamic structure that keep
remodeling itself on a short time scale compared to the speed at which a cell
move. That's through this dynamics that the cytoskeleton can achieve its
functions.  As mammals skeletons are necessary to transmit force from one part
of the body to another, the cell cytoskeleton is responsible to not only
transmit the force the cell is exerting, but also to generate theses force.
Thats through its cytoskeleton that a cell can be connected to its environment,
both mechanically and biochemically.

The cytoskeleton is mainly composed of three type of filaments.  The
microtubules, intermediate filament and actin filament, also known as
microfilaments.

.. Microtubules

Microtubules are the wider with a diameter of 20nm and :num:`Fig #fig-mt` the
stiffer of the three kinds of filament with a persistence length in the order
of millimeter, which is much longer than the size of the usual cell.
Microtubules are extensively studied :cite:`cite some reviews ...`.
Microtubules are formed by the polymerisation of an heterodimer of tubuline
that lead to the formation of polar (oriented) filament that can be walked on
by molecular motors. These molecular motors can be decomposed in two families –
kinesins and dyneins – depending on the end toward which the motor preferably
walk.  Microtubules are mostly known for their action during the cells mitosis
where they will form majority of the mitotic spindle that drive the segregation
of the chromosomes in two groups, each group ending in one of the daughter
cells. 

Microtubules have the characteristic of being highly dynamic by alternating
between two state of rapid growth after what is called a `rescue` , and a rapid
shrinkage after a `catastrophe`

    Biology of the Cell`





.. Intermediate filament


Intermediate filaments are of medium diameter in the order of around 10nm, in
between actin and microtubules filament, hence their name.  Unlike microtubules
and actin filament, intermediate filaments are composed by several sub-families
of proteins and are non-polar.

Intermediate filament have an important role in the mechanical properties of
the cell due to the fact that they are particularly  resistant to stretching. 

Unlike actin and microtubules, they are thought to be passive, with mechanical
properties mainly deriving from how multiple filaments are linked together
laterally.

.. Actin


Actin, is the third component of the cytoskeleton, the one we will focus most
of our effort. Actin monomers polymerises into actin filament, the thinest of
the three kind that form the cytoskeleton. Actin is produced in the cell as a
globular protein of ~40 kDa that once associated with ATP or ADP polymerises
into helicoidal filament with a diameter between 7 and 9nm. The formed actin
filament are polar, which both extremity respectively called the plus (`+`) or
barbed end, and the minus (`-`) or pointed end. The polarity of the actin
filament is of importance as this give rise to a proved direction for most
processes that can happen on the filament.


The actin protein is highly conserved across species, and is know to directly
interact with hundreds of proteins :cite:`DosRemedios2003`. As hint before it
can in particular bind to ATP, that can hydrolyse into, ADP

Single undecorated filament will behave at the scale of the cell as
semi-flexible polymer with a persistence length in the order of 10 µm. When the
assemble into different structure and network, or associate with other proteins
and molecule the resulting mechanical and dynamic properties can be highly changed.

Dynamic of actin polymerisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The assembly mechanism that allow to go from single monomers of actin (also
refer to as G-actin) to actin filament (also refer as F-actin)
need to be well understood to explain the different networks structures actin
filaments can create in presence of other proteins.

The polymerisation of ATP/ADP actin monomer to form an actin filament
need to go through the step of forming an actin proto-filament which
is constituted of at least 3 actin monomers. This will most of the
time be the kinetically limiting step. Once proto-filaments are
present in solution, single monomers can be freely added or removed on
both ends of the filament.  The process of forming these
proto-filament is called the nucleation and is the rate limiting factor
to form actin filament from actin monomers. To circumvent this
limitation experimentally one can use actin filament seed, or actin
nucleator to direct the polymerisation on cell as cell does.

We need to distinguish between the dynamics of polymerisation and
depolymerisation on both ends of the filament. Indeed it has been show that the
association and dissociation rate are differing between the pointed (-) and
barbed (+) end. The barbed end has a  higher dynamic that its pointed
counterpart which is the reason that give it its (+) name. The dynamics of
polymerisation  is higher both in he case of ATP and ADP, though the rate
constant of association and dissociation differ for both kind of filaments.

.. _fig-actin:

.. figure:: /figs/elongation-rate-constant.png     
    :alt: "Elongation rate constant of actin filament as measured by Pollard 2003"
    :width: 25%

    Association and dissociation rate of both ATP and ADP actin on pointed and
    barbed end as measured in :cite:`pollard2003`. The difference of
    equilibrium constant between the barbed end (bottom) in the presence of ATP
    allow filament treadmilling.




The equations that drive the polymerisation can be written as follow

.. math::

    \frac{dC_{barbed}}{dt} &= k_{+,{barbed}}.[monomers] - k_{-,{barbed}} \\
    \frac{dC_{pointed}}{dt} &= k_{+,{pointed}}.[monomers] - k_{-,{pointed}} \\

Where `barbed` and `pointed` designate respectively the barbed and pointed end, and
:math:`k_+` and :math:`k_-` are the polymerisation and de-polymerisation rate.
The concentration in barbed and pointed end denoted by :math:`C_{{barbed}/{pointed}}`. By
assuming that the number of pointed end is equal to the number of barbed end,
one can derive the steady state which give rise to the critical monomer
concentration below which an actin filament cannot grow: :math:`[monomers]_c`.

The rate constant of elongation of actin have been determined to also depend of
whether the monomer was bound to ADP or ATP :cite:`Pollard1986`. We should now
consider the fact that ATP-bound actin will hydrolyse to ADP-Pi then release
the inorganic phosphate, and thus with a rate which also depend on whether the
monomer is part of a filament or in solution. With the hydrolysis of ATP-bound
actin into ADP bound actin in the filament, this lead to an imbalance of actin
(de)-polymerisation on both ends, which leads to actin filament preferably
growing on the barbed end and preferably shrinking from the pointed end.

This will lead to a phenomenon known ad treadmilling where a single actin
monomer bound to an ATP molecule, will be incorporated at the `+` end of the
filament and progressively move toward the minus end, eventually hydrolysing it
ATP into ADP before detaching from the filament on the pointed end. During this
process the filament will grow / shrink until it reaches the stationary state
where its length would stay constant but the treadmilling continues.

Treadmilling require an imbalance in the global rate constant on the barbed and
pointed end and an energy source, in the case of actin this is provided by the
hydrolysis of ATP into ADP+Pi before releasing the inorganic phosphate, without
whom treadmilling would not occurs.

Practically this can be approximated by having only ATP monomers at the barbed
end of actin filament wile pointed end is constituted only of ADP monomers,
thus the critical concentration is lower at the  pointed end. The barbed end
have a higher critical concentration. The growth speed of the filament depend
on both end depends on the monomer concentration in solution and in between the
critical concentration of both ends exist a concentration at which the
polymerisation on (+) exactly compensate the depolymerisation on (-).

    cannot.

Actin network can be controlled by a host of actin binding proteins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Despite the already complex process that is actin polymerisation and the
numbers of parameter that we have already introduced, the formation of an actin
network is an even more complex process that involve many other components.
Especially, actin monomers and filament can interact with a high number of
proteins that will affect the previously introduced dynamics.  We will present
some categories of such protein in the following.

Formins
"""""""

`Formins` are polymerase proteins that will increase the polymerisation rate
of actin filament by dimerizing and binding to the barbed end. It has the
particularity of being processive, meaning that it will stay bound to the
barbed and while catalysing the addition of new monomers. The processivity of
formins also permit the control of the localization of actin polymerisation
where formin proteins are present, like the tip of filopodia :cite:`Faix2006`
:cite:`Bornschlogl2013`. `Formin` posses domains rich in proline capable of
binding to profilin (`FH1`) which allow formin to elongate F-Actin using actin
monomers bounds to profilin :cite:`Pruyne2002` :cite:`Pring2003a`.


Actin depolymerization and severing
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Like polymerisation that can be enhanced by some proteins, depolymerization can
also be speed up by divers proteins. ADF/Cofilin is a protein
which is able to speedup the depolymerization of actin either by increasing the
off rate at the pointed end :cite:`Carlier1997`, or by actively severing the
filament in different point, thus disassembling the formed network :cite:`McCullough2011`.

It should be noted that depolymerization can not only be  enhanced at the
pointed end, indeed formin is also able to accelerate the detachment of actin
monomers at the barbed end.

Capping Protein
"""""""""""""""

To regulate polymerisation, cells also have the possibility to reduce or stop
the polymerisation. To achieve this, some proteins will bind to the growing end
of actin filament and prevent the addition of new monomers.  `Capping Protein`
(CP) being one particular example that will specifically bind to the barbed end
of a growing filament and  prevent here from growing. Capping proteins are
necessary to prevent polymerisation of actin in undesired area
and are essential for the structure and mechanical properties of actin gel
:cite:`Kawska2012`. `Gelsoline` is another example of capping protein, that
unlike CP can only attached to the barbed end of an actin filament after
severing it. Gelsoline is hence both a severing and a capping protein.

.. todo:: 
    refs look for a review

Cross-linkers
""""""""""""

We have seen that some proteins were able to attach to actin filaments. When
such a protein is able to attach to many filament at once, it can act as an
attachment point between the two filament, preventing them to move with respect
one to each other. Such proteins, are referred to as cross-linkers.

.. todo::
    ref to review

The amount of freedom in movement between the two filaments is dependant of the
used cross-linker. For example , α-actinin will allow rotation of the two
filament at their anchoring point whereas cross-linker like fascine will prefer
a parallel conformation of the filament and favor the formation of actin
bundles.

Stabilizing actin filaments
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As actin network a dynamics construct that are changing shape and properties
with time, it is convenient to be able to stabilize those network. Tropomyosins
are proteins capable to bind on the side of actin filament to stabilize them.

The use of phalloidin, a toxin extracted from fungus, is also common as by
binding between F-actin subunits on the filament, it prevent it from
de polymerising.  Though, it is known that stabilizing actin filaments with
phalloidin will increase they persistence length which can change the
mechanical properties of the formed actin network.

Molecular Motor
"""""""""""""""

A particular kind of protein that can bind to cytoskeleton filament are
molecular motors. Molecular motors are proteins that will consume energy source
in the form of ATP, hydrolyse it to change conformation and produce forces.

Different motors exist for each kinds of filament. The  one that walk on
F-actin are part of the myosin family. Myosins head will bond on the side of
F-actin filament and the hydrolysis on ATP into ADP will produce a power stroke
that will make the myosin tail to move in the direction of the pointed. This
will make myosin walking preferably toward the barbed end of actin filament,
pulling anything being attached to its tail with it. The mechanism that allow
myosin to reliably walk toward the right end of the actin filament will depend
on the type of Myosins, Myosins V for example will be processive and the
single dimers with two head will be able to effect several step in a row.
Whereas `Myosin II` is only able to effect one step before detaching from the
actin filament the processivity being statistically achieve by having  a high
number of myosin filament bundled together. 

.. todo::

    This need to be an expanded section with equal weight to ARP. Explain more
    about its function and give a figure _________ get inspired by Alberts.

    Important : Introduce minifilaments, make the difference between  head and
    tail, _______ introduce the duty ratio, and the difference between Muscle
    and Cell Myosine II.



Molecular motors that binds on actin are regrouped under the myosin family.
The Myosin family is subdivided in subfamilies each with their specificities.
Each subfamily is numbered with the roman numeral. Despite the high number of
myosin motors and family, they all share common characteristics. All Myosin are
molecular motors that binds to actin and are able to convert the energy
released by ATP to ADP hydrolysis to generate force. Except Myosin VI[How are
the cellular functions of myosin VI regulated within the cell?] and IX 
:cite:`Inoue2002`, all myosin walk on actin filament toward the  barbed end. 

Myosin structure is composed of three part. The first part, the myosin head, is
the par that bind to the actin filament and is responsible for the ATP
hydrolysis and the "Power Stroke" that will generate the myosin motion. 
The second part, called neck, is often responsible for regulatory structure for
the myosin. It also act as a lever arm which will convert the conformational
change of the bound myosin motor into a physical displacement of the cargo the
myosin carries.
The third part, also refer to as tail, is usually the part to which cargo
attached, and the part that will allow different categories of myosin to
dimerize or for minifilaments.


.. figure:: /figs/figure-16-54a.jpg     
    :alt: "Schematic of a myosin II motor"
    :width: 70%

    A schematic of a dimer of myosin motors with the example of Myosin II, also
    known as muscle myosin. Each of the myosin monomer is colored in a
    different shade of green. From Right to Left, the myosin head, with the N
    terminal is the part of the myosin that binds to the actin filaments. The
    neck region with the light chain act as a lever arm that linked to Myosin
    tail, here constituted with coiled-coil alpha-helix.


Myosin are part of molecular motors due to the fact that they can convert
chemical energy (in the form of ATP hydrolysis) to motion. Lets describe the
cycle that allow such phenomenon taking the example of Myosin II also known as
muscle myosin. The cycle can be decomposed in 5 steps, last of which will be responsible for the forced exerted on the myosin cargo.

    - The myosin start in the 'rigor' conformation where it is lightly bound to
      the actin filament.

    - An ATP molecule binds to the myosin head inducing the detachment of the
      myosin from the actin filament.

    - ATP molecule is hydrolysed into ADP+Pi, providing energy which is stored
      into a conformational change of the myosin which effect a recovery
      stroke. 

    - Inorganic phosphate is released as the myosin head attaches to the actin
      filament.

    - The actin-bound myosin change conformation, applying forces on it's
      cargo. This step is known as the power-stroke and is responsible for most
      of the applied force or displacement of the myosin. During the
      power-stroke the ADP bound to the myosin head is released, leading back
      to first step of the cycle.


Myosin motors can achieve relatively reliable transport of cargo along actin
filament. But we saw in the description of myosin cycle that myosin heads spend
a certain amount of time detached from microfilaments. Different type of myosin
have developed different strategy to guaranty reliable motion to ward the barbed end of actin filament. 

The first parameter which govern myosin behavior is name the duty-ratio. It is
a measure of the amount of amount of time a myosin spend attached to its actin
filament over the total time of a cycle.  By noting :math:`\tau_{on}` and
:math:`\tau_{off}` the myosin head binding site respectively spend
attached/detached from  the filament we can define the duty-ratio (also called
duty-cycle) :

.. math::
    r = \frac{\tau_{on}}{\tau_{on}+\tau_{off}}

The duty-ration is hence comprised between 0 and 1, with a value close to 1
meaning that the myosin is most of the time bound to the actin filament, and a
value close to 0, meaning that the myosin spend most of its time detached.  

To achieve processivity, myosin can either target a high duty-ration and form
dimers, or aggregate into mini filament which always are attached to their
actin counterpart due to the number of head in them.

Myosin V, which is found to be responsible for actin network dynamics and
vesicle positioning :cite:`Holubcova2013`, achieve hi-processivity by forming
dimer with a hi-duty ratio for each of the monomer. This will actually allow
the dimer to "walk" along actin filament from the minus end to the pointed end.

Myosin II has a similar structure to myosin V dimers, bus dimers can bundle
themselves with the tails of other myosin II forming long bipolar
minifilaments. The minifilaments have then high number of myosin head that can
can attach to an actin bundle.

These bipolar minifilaments is what are found in muscles sarcomere, by allowing
actin filament to slide in opposite direction. Mechanism at the origin of
muscle contraction. 
 
.. Latrunculin
.. """""""""""
.. 
.. Another toxin that act on actin is latrunculin, secreted by sponges,it bind to
.. actin monomer preventing them to polymerise.  In presence of latrunculin, actin
.. filament can though only depolymerize.


Profilin
""""""""

Profilin is a protein that will bind to the barbed end of single monomers of
actin in solution.  By doing so it will first prevent the association of
monomers into dimers and trimmers, thus preventing the nucleation of actin
filament. It thus allows a better control of localisation of actin filament
both in vivo and in vitro in the presence of actin seeds of actin nucleator.

Profilin as for a long time been believed to be only a sequestering protein
that inhibit polymerisation :cite:`Yarmola2009`, though it has a more complex
behavior, and if it prevent polymerisation of actin filaments by the pointed
end, it can facilitate polymerisation. One of the cause of increase in
polymerisation speed by profilin is the fact it binds preferably to ADP-Actin
and increase the exchange rate of ADP into ATP. :cite:`probably something, look in Yarmola`.




Nucleation promoting factory
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Nucleation promoting factor, or NPF... 

.. todo:: 
   Write things on NPF, or should  I leave that as subpart like for ARP2/3


Branching Agent
"""""""""""""""

We have seen previously that crosslinker were proteins capable on linking two
or more actin filament together by binding on their side. Another mechanism
involving binding on the side on actin filament is responsible for a closely
related network, the branching mechanism. 

The Arp2/3 complex is composed of seven subunits, two of which are highly
similar with actin, from Arp2 and Arp3 family for Actin Related Proteins,
giving the complex its name. Arp2/3 will bond on the side of a pre-existing
actin filament, from which will grow a daughter filament that for an angle of
70° from the mother filament. The newly created daughter filament pointed end
is terminated by the Arp2/3 complex that will stay attached to the mother
filament, thus increasing the number of available barbed end, without changing
the number of available pointed end. Cf Nature Review by Erin D. Goley and
Matthew D. Welch :cite:`Goley2006` for  a longer nger review about the Arp2/3
complex.

The network formed by Arp2/3 is called a dentritic network, and is in particular
found at the leading edge of the cell, and it is such a network is present in
the bead system we will study hereafter.

When first binding to the actin filament the Arp2/3 complex is initially inactive, it
needs the help of another protein to start the nucleation actin nucleation process.

    promoting factor will activate Arp2/3 which will act both as a nucleation
    factor and a branching agent. An from an activated Arp2/3 will grow –
    toward the membrane – an additional daughter filament. Newly growing barbed
    end can eventually be capped by capping protein which will terminate their
    growth. Aging monomer in actin filament will slowly hydrolyse their ATP,
    eventually releasing the inorganic phosphate before detaching from the
    pointed end. Depolymerisation is helped by severing protein and Actin
    Depolymerisation Factor. ADP-actin monomer will bind to profilin will will
    increase the turn over rate to ATP-actin which will be reuse by the leading
    edge of the cell.

Cell Organelle
==============

Beyond the membrane, cytoplasm and cytoskeleton, cell have a number of
structure that have different and specialised function. The position and
state of each of theses structure is of great importance in order for the
cell to achieve its function. Probably the most known of the organelles is
the cell nucleus of eukaryotes cells that contain the genetic material of the
cell. Attached to the nucleus is the endoplasmic reticulum (also know as ER)
is the organelle that is responsible form translating RNA coming from to
nucleus in to functional proteins that will be delivered across the cell
after maturation through vesicles. Theses vesicles are transported across the
cell by dyneins and kinesins, molecular motors, that walks along microtubules
originating from the centrioles part of the centrosome. All of those process
consume energy as the form of ATP, generated from with the mitocondrion spread
across the cytoplasm.

Like the cell is separated from the external environment by a lipid bilayer
that form the cytoplasmic membrane, each of the organelles are separated from
the cytosol by a membrane with a particular composition, properties and function.


Then positioning of organelle can be of high importance for the life of an
organism.  During meiotic division of cell, for example, it has been seen that
the positioning of the nucleus at the center of the cell in mouse oocyte happen
before its migration closer to the cortex to expel the first polar body.
Failure to do so result in a incorrect amount of DNA in germinal cell that can
lead to infertility.

Same goes with the centrosome which positions at two opposite point in the cell
when it start to divide. Microtubules emanating from theses centriole will be
used to fetch the correct chromosomes and pull them to each of the centrosome
to get the same amount of DNA into each of the daughter cells.

The position of the organelles can have more unexpected effect. In particular,
some nocturnal locust adapt their vision depending on the light condition by
modifying the properties of a part of their eye called the omatidium.  More
specially, the refractive index if each organelle being slightly different, the
reorganisation of the position on mitocondrion and endoplasmic reticulum inside
the cell has been show to be droved by actin polymerisation and responsible
from changed in optical properties in locust eye :cite:`Sturmer1995`.


Movement of organelles is also crucial for plant biology, indeed, genetic
material is sensitive to UV light, and protecting it is necessary for plant
survival. Iwabuchi et al. have show that actin is responsible for the migration
of the cell nucleus away from the part of the cell the more exposed to the
damaging light :cite:`Iwabuchi2010`.
