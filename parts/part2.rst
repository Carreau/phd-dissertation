(verprolin homology central and acidic domain) into Rosetta
2(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) Cell.  Purified pWA is aliquoted and conserved at -80°C, never
refrozen, and conserved on ice for daily use.


Actin

Actin and biotinylated actin are purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO, USA), and stored at -80°C.
Fluorescent Alexa-488 actin is obtained from Molecular Probes, stored at -80°C, and prepared according to manufacturer recommendation.

Actin is stored in 5µL aliquots at a concentration of ~238 µM, and
fluorescent actin in 3µL aliquots at a concentration of ~106 µM.

G-actin with 20% fluorescently labeled actin monomers is prepared the day before
the experiment, by mixing 1 aliquot of actin with 1 aliquot of fluorescently
labeled actin, and by diluting the mix with G-Buffer until the desired concentration is reached.

Capping protein
=================
.. 3

Mouse capping protein (CP; a1/b2) is purified as previously described in :cite:`Soeno1998`. CP was a gift from Laurent Blanchoin.

Myosin II
=========
.. 3

Myosin II is purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and fluorescent myosin II is
prepared as previously described in :cite:`SoareseSilva2011`. The Myosin II functionality
is confirmed by motility assays. Gliding speed shows an average of 4.5
+ 1.5 µm/s (N = 27).

The working buffer for Myosin contains 

    - 25 mM imidazole
    - 50 mM :math:`KCl`
    - 70 mM sucrose
    - 1mM Tris
    - 2 mM :math:`MgCl_2`
    - 1 mM ATP
    - 0.1 mM DTT
    - 0.02 mg/ml β-casein,

Then,  pH is adjusted to 7.4.
In the working buffer, myosin II
forms monofilaments about 0.7 µm long, which roughly correspond to about 100
motors. 

Lipids, reagent and proteins
****************************
.. 2

Chemicals are purchased from Sigma Aldricht (St-Louis, Mo, USA, unless stated otherwise. 
EPC (l-:math:`\alpha`-phosphatidylcholine) and `1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[biotinyl polyethylene glycol 2000]` 
(biotinylated lipids), `1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine` are purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, USA).
Monomeric actin containing 10% or 20% of labeled Alexa-488
actin and 0.25 % of biotinylated actin is diluted in G-Buffer 



.. _electroformation:

Doublet preparation
********************
.. 2

Cell-sized liposomes are formed by electro formation :cite:`Angelova1986`.
A 20 µL mix of EPC lipids and PEG-biotin lipids (present at 0.1 %, mol ),
at a 2.5 mg/ml in chloroform/methanol 5:3 concentration, is deposited on glass
plates coated with  ITO. Glass is then dried with  nitrogen and placed
under vacuum for 2 hours.



A chamber is formed, using the ITO plates with their conductive sides facing
inside, then filled with sucrose buffer (200mM sucrose, 2mM Tris adjusted  to a pH of
7.4). The. Chamber  is finally sealed with hematocrit paste (Vitrex Medical, Denmark).

An alternate current voltage of 1V at 10 Hz is applied between the ITO-coated
surfaces for 75 minutes, to form liposomes.

The same preparation is done a second time and, by adding 0.9µm sulphorhodamin to
the sucrose buffer,  the liposomes inside buffer are marked fluorescently.


The two solutions are mixed in order to have the inside buffer of half the
liposomes marked in red, and being to be able to distinguish the interface in some of
the formed doublets.

The formed liposomes are incubated 15 minutes with 160 nM streptavidin in order to
get them coated with it. Streptavidin-coated liposomes tend to
aggregate.  The solution containing doublets is then diluted 30 times. Waiting
15 minutes increases the ratio doublets/single liposomes, by still avoiding
the aggregates of more liposomes. 

A bulk solution of 40 µM actin monomers — 10% fluorescent and 0.25% biotinylated — is
diluted 40 times in a working buffer (25 mM imidazole, 50 mM KCl, 70 mM sucrose,
1mM Tris, 2 mM :math:`MgCl_2`, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.02 mg/ml β-casein, adjusted at to a
pH of 7.4) and polymerized for one hour. The adjunction of 1 µm of phalloidin
after 1 hour prevents further depolymerisation.

Actin filaments are 
diluted to 0.1 µM (10x), mixed with streptavidin-coated doublets of
liposomes, and incubated for 15 min. The mix is diluted 5 times to reduce the fluorescent background due to actin monomers in solution. 

.. _bead_preparation:

Bead Preparation
****************
.. 2

Carboxylated polystyrene beads (Polysciences, Philadelphia, PA) of 4.34 ± 0.239
μm (Standard deviation) diameter were used as actin-beads and probe-beads.

Beads are stored at 4°C.

Before being coated by BSA (probe-bead) or pWA (actin-bead), the bead solution is
cleaned by centrifugation at 5000 rpm, 2min. After removing the supernatant, the pellet
is resuspended in X-Buffer. This procedure is repeated twice.



Actin-Bead Preparation 
=======================
.. 3

Cleaned polystyrene beads are incubated for 20 min at 20°C under agitation with
2 μM pVCA. Centrifuged at 5000rpm 2min, the supernatant is removed and the pellet
diluted 4 times in X-buffer. The beads are stored on ice for one day.


Probe Bead Preparation
======================
.. 3

Cleaned polystyrene beads are incubated under agitation with 10 mg/ml BSA at
room temperature for 30 minutes. Passivated beads are then centrifuged,
separated from supernatant, the pellet is resuspended in X-BSA buffer and
stored at 4°C for weekly use.


.. _force-indentation-experiments:

Force indentation experiments
*****************************

Preparation of sample 
======================
.. 3


An equal amount of both actin and probe beads are placed in the polymerization
mix consisting of : 

    - 2µL BSA at 10%
    - 3µL of ATP-Mix Buffer
    - 1.5 µL Profilin (114µM)
    - 1 µL beads (50% actin-bead 50% probe bead)
    - 0.5 µL Arp2/3 (22,3 µM)
    - between 0 and 2 µL CP (0.5 µM)
    - Completed to 15 µL using X-Buffer.

.. Todo::
    There are XX letters in the concentration for VaLaP, please fill in.

5 µL of G-Actin (20% fluorescent) is then added to the previous mix. This
moment marks the time `t=0` for the experiment and recording. The experimental chamber is
made of 2 coverslips, separated by VaLaP, which is a mix of vaseline (33%)
Lanoline (33%) and Parafine(33%) in equal mass proportion. The chamber is prepared by gently depositing 20 µL of
the final beads mix at the lower coverslip center and 4 drops of VaLaP
where the corner of the upper (18x18mm) coverslip
will rest. The VaLaP, acting as a spacer, prevents the sample from being squashed.  The
upper coverslip is then placed on top of the sample and the chamber is sealed
with VaLaP.

.. _laser_calibration:

QPD positioning and calibration of microscope
=============================================
.. 3

The prepared sample is placed on the microscope and a drop of water is
deposited on top of the upper coverslip to assure  the immersion of the light
collecting objective. The collecting objective and the quadrant photodiode are
placed on top of the sample (:ref:`Optical tweezer <optical-tweezer>`).

  

The trapping laser is then aligned with the photodiode, checking in the meantime that no
object is trapped during the process. The conjugation of the objective back focal plane
with the AODs and the QPD, is optimized by adjusting the
distance of both objectives with respect to the sample. 

A trapping laser is positioned near the center of the microscope field of view,
using the custom written LabView program (:num:`Fig #fig-frontend`). The QPD is adjusted in X and Y direction to
:math:`\Delta X  = \Delta Y = 0V`. This has to be  done while no object is trapped in
the  laser focus.

Initial bead trapping
=====================
.. 3

Two maximum strength traps (~50mW/trap) are created near the center of the
microscope field of view, separated by 15 to 20 µm. The sample plane is then moved in
the Z-direction, by displacing the 3D piezo controlled sample stage, to position the traps 
near the chamber middle plane. A temporary removal of the infrared filter 
from the microscope allows to see the trapping lasers reflection on both the
upper and lower coverslips and to determine the localisation of the observation chamber middle plane
.

.. _fig-frontend:
.. figure:: figs/frontend.png
    :width: 90%

    Software interface responsible for controlling the optical tweezer.  Sample
    image showing 2 polystyrene beads and a single trap (A, white cross) holding one bead.
    Cursors (B,C) are available to displace the optical trap(s).  Cursors can
    control the position of the stage: X (D), Y (E, blue) and Z (E,red). 
    The blue rectangle highlights the slider that allows the control of the traps power.  The red
    rectangle highlights the area where the different parameters of the experiment
    can be set (approach speed and resting time at closest point). 3 indicators at
    the bottom of the screen indicate the voltage on the QPD.


The operator then captures one probe-bead and one actin-bead in each
trap.  Both types of beads can be recognized using fluorescent microscopy, as
actin-beads, promptly covered with a fluorescent actin, 
can clearly be distinguished from the probe-beads, which remain dark.
If two identical beads are trapped, one of the two traps can selectively
be disabled or decreased in stiffness, letting the bead escape from it ,
and the procedure can be repeated.

The operator will then roughly move the two traps one micrometer in each
direction, to check that the two beads are effectively trapped in the tweezer and
that no external forces act on the beads. 

.. Finally the operator verifies that the two traps are aligned along one of the
.. principal axis of the AODs, to avoid the "ghost trap" phenomenon. 

For practical reasons, the traps are aligned along one of the principal axis
of the AOD, before starting the indentation experiments.


Indentations
============
.. 3

The operator sets the experiment parameters in the software: 

    - Average bead radius, 
    - Approach/Retraction Speed.
    - Resting Time
    - Laser Power

For each pair of actin/probe beads, the initial minimum approach distance of the
traps is set to 5 to 8 µm, before doing a single indentation cycle. If the
maximum measured force between the two beads is not higher than 8 to 10 pN, the
minimum approach distance is reduced by 0.25 to 1 µm and the procedure
repeated. Once the maximum force measured is in the 10-15pN range, the right
distance is found and up to 10 automatic force-indentation experiments are
performed (:num:`Fig #bead-move`) . Before each indentation, the software automatically does a "scan" of
each bead, to ensure correct calibration. An indentation cycle has the
following steps : 

    - Probe trap is approaching the actin-bead at constant speed until the minimal approach distance has been reached.
    - At the minimal distance, the traps remain stationary for the predefined (typically 3 seconds) resting time.
    - Probe trap returns to its initial position at constant speed.
    - Cycle is repeated as many times as set.

During this cycle, the deflection of the laser induced by both probe-bead and
actin-bead are recorded by the QPD.

After an indentation cycle is finished, the experimenter can try to perform the
indentation on the actin-bead from another direction, or release the actin-bead,
proceeding to a new one.

In case the indented actin network shows signs of inhomogeneity or
symmetry breaking, the experiments are stopped and not taken into account for
further analysis.

The date and time of each indentation cycle is recorded, to extract the time of
polymerisation for each sample.

.. _bead-move:

    :width: 50%

    Schematic of indentation experiment. On the left is the actin-bead, covered
    with actin, in the static trap, on the right the probe-bead in the mobile
    trap. At the beginning of the experiment (A) the probe-bead is situated far from
    the actin-bead. During the approach phase (I) the moving trap approaches
    the static trap at 10µm/sec until it reaches the minimal approach
    distance (B). The moving trap stays at the minimal approach distance for
    3sec (II), which constitutes the relaxation phase.C) The actin gels are
    relaxed, the distance between bead is smaller than on B. III), the moving
    trap retracts at 10 µm/sec back to its initial position.




.. _time_shared_ot:

Time Shared Optical Traps
*************************
.. 2


The optical trap is built on an inverted microscope (Olympus, IX71) equipped with
a fluorescence (200W mercury lamp, Osram, Munich, Germany). The sample is observed
through an Olympus 60X water immersion objective (Olympus) with numerical aperture NA=1.2, that also
serves at the entry point of the optical tweezer laser.  The light source is 
an infrared fiber laser (:math:`\lambda=1064nm`, YLP-1-1064, IPG,
Germany). The X, Y positionings and the trapping force stiffness are controlled
by 2 Acousto Optic Deflectors (AODs, AA-Optoelectronics, France) that are placed  in the conjugated plane of
the objective back focal plane . 
Multiple traps can be achieved by switching the laser between
multiple positions within a switching time, in the order of 5 µs, and resting
on each position 20µs or more. 


Light refracted by the trapped sample is collected by a 40X (N.A:0.9, Olympus)
water immersion objective, and imaged on a quadrant photodiode (QPD) conjugated
with the back focal plane of the light collection objective. Signals from the
QPD (:math:`\Delta X, \Delta Y` and :math:`\Sigma`) are sampled at 500kHz, by a Digital
To Analogic Aquisition card (NI PCIe-6363, National Instruments, Austin,
Texas) and controlled by a custom written Labview software (National Instruments)
coupled with Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Raw signals are preprocessed by binning all 
voltages measured during the laser resting time (typically 20µs, at one position). Finally,
the mean and standard deviation for each trap visit is stored for further processing.

The trap stiffness is inferred from bead radius, laser power, number of present
traps and controlled experiment data. In controlled experiments, the trap stiffness was
calibrated using the power spectral density method, and was determined
to be as high as 80 pN/µm at full laser power (119mW) for a single trap.
In the case of multiplexing, both traps as used in this work, were calibrated before
the experiment. 
The sample coarse positioning was achieved through a pair of micrometer precision
screws, capable of translating the microscope stage in X and Y, and finer positionings in X,Y and Z directions  with the help of a 3D piezo stage, with 
an accessible range of 80 µm in each direction and a sub-micrometer accuracy.

Oocyte culture, collection, and micro injection?, were done at the College de France by Maria Almonacid.

Oocytes were collected from 11 to 15 week old mice (WT), fmn2-/- as previously
described in :cite:`Holubcova2013` and maintained in Prophase I in M2+BSA
supplemented with  1µM Milrinone. Oocyte were then injected with cRNA,  using a
micro-injector Eppendorf FemtoJet. Imaging was carried out at :math:`37^\circ{}C`.
