Optical Trap Setup
==================

Preface
-------

In order to manipulate the polystyrene beads that are used in the different
experiments, I worked on a already build setup with time shared optical trap


To investigate the effect of different actin network on mechanics of cell
behavior, Sykes team of curie institute is specialized in using biomimetics
sytems. In particular, polystyrene actin bead covered with nucleator of actin
polymerisation have been developped as a biomimetic system of listeria
monocytogen. It is such a system that I have studied. 

By growing actin network in controlled condition I was able to reproductibly
determine mechanical properties.

Choice of experimental tools
----------------------------


The choice of experimental tools, and experimental conditions is important to
determine in the range of properties and parameters you can access to.
Previous and ongoing studies at the time were focused on the properties of dense
gel in comets tails, as well as the one around the polystyrene beads, as well as the one on the surface before symetry breaking.

Liposome doublets
=================

In this chapter we study the comportment of what we will refer as "Doublets";
an biomimetic system that allow us to study quantitatively the tension on a
membrane covered with a actin shell mimicking the cells actin cortex. Even if
such a system has already been studied, we believe that the new technique we
develop can allow the non-invasive measure of variation of tension on liposome.

.. _figDoubletsSchema:

.. figure:: /figs/doublets-schema.png
    :alt: Formation doublet schema


    Single liposome can formxe a doublets with a single double double layer
    separating them, adhere with a double bi-layer, or cover with atin.  Bare
    doublets can then get covered with actin and actin covered liposome can
    adhere together. The two kinds of doublets can be differentiated by using
    fluorescently labeled acctin.

    
    
    
    
Starting with a liposome solution containing
biotinilated actin filament and streptavidine doublet will naturally
occurs. Liposomes will either adhere before or after being covered with
actin filament. In the rest of this chapter we are interested in studying
only the case where both liposome adhere before being in coverd with actin.
To increase the ratio of both kinds of doublet, the solution of liposome is
gently centrifuged before adding the F-actin into the mix. As experiments
were done using fluorescently labeled actin, the discrimination between the
two kinds of doublets was easily done looking at the fluorescent intensity
on the interface between the two doublets. Only doublet where no signal on
the interface was visible were analysed.


Relating Doublets to Living cell
--------------------------------

Determining contact angle in cell is the often use methods to determine effective tension of membrane linked to cythoskeleton. :cite:Leon Maitre:


Doublets geometric parameter
----------------------------

Using biomimetic system allow to more control over a system and decrease the
number of parameter one have to study to better understand there influence.
Unlike cell that are active and constantly shape changing, liposome have a
shape that follow a smaller number of physical law. This translate in the right
condition to liposome taking a spherical form. Knowing this information we
derived a methods to determine the contact angle between liposome in a less
experimentor biased way.

In this section we will show that the geometrical parameters of a doublet can
be modeled by the combinaison of two intersecting sphere, simulate the
fluorescent image that such a doublet would generate  and show that we can
optimise the parameters of the model to reflect the exerimental data thus
determining the actual geometrical parameter of the doublets in an experimentor
independant mater by also automatising the system.


In the following par we will restrain ourselves to example in a two dimensional
space for easier visualisation and work in pixel for convenience


Finding a single liposome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Experimentally liposomes are observed using fluorescently labeled component, in
particular we used a GFP labeled actin and streptavidine that will be imaged
using a inverted microscope. In the observation plane, the liposome formed
using fluorescently labeled streptavine will form a bright ringi of given
thickness.  When imaging the actin shell, assuming the actinshell is of
homogeneous thickness around the liposome will also manifest as a fluorecent ring.

In the case where the membrane is marked, the radius of liposome will be the median radius of the ring. 

In the case of actin shell, when the thickness of the actin shell is bigger compared the resolution limit of our method, then the liposome radius should be taken as the inner raius of the ring

.. 
.. Bicycle Parameters
.. ------------------
.. 
.. 
.. We measured the physical characteristics of eleven different bicycles, three of
.. which were set up in two different configurations. The first six bicycles,
.. chosen for both variety and convenience, are as follows: *Batavus Browser*, a
.. Dutch style city bicycle measured with and without instrumentation as described
.. in :cite:`Kooijman2009a`; *Batavus Stratos Deluxe*, a Dutch style sporty city
.. bicycle; *Batavus Crescendo Deluxe* a Dutch style city bicycle with a suspended
.. fork; *Gary Fisher Mountain Bike*, a hard-tail mountain bicycle; *Bianchi
.. Pista*, a modern steel frame track racing bicycle; and *Yellow Bicycle*, a
.. stripped down aluminum frame road bicycle measured in two configurations, the
.. second with the fork rotated in the head tube 180 degrees for larger trail. The
.. last two bicycles were measured in Davis: the instrumented bicycle presented in
.. chapter :ref:`davisbicycle` and a children's bicycle with a stabilizing
.. flywheel called the GyroBike.
.. 
.. 
.. Of primarily concern was measuring and estimating the 25 parameters associated
.. with the benchmark Whipple bicycle model which is derived and described in
.. :cite:`Meijaard2007`. The unforced two degree-of-freedom, :math:`\mathbf{q} =
.. [\delta \quad \phi]^T` model takes the form:
..

..    +v\mathbf{C}_1\mathbf{\dot{q}}

..    The ten measured bicycles: (a) Batavus Browser, (b) Instrumented Batavus
..    Browser, (c) Batavus Crescendo Deluxe, (d) Batavus Stratos Deluxe, (e) Gary
..    Fisher, (f) Bianchi Pista, (g) Yellow Bicycle, (h) Yellow Bicycle with
..    reversed fork, (i) Davis Instrumented Bicycle, (j) Gyro Bicycle. The Davis
..    Instrumented Bicycle was measured twice each with the body cast and seat
..    height in different positions. The first "Rigid" was set up for Jason and
..    the second "Rigidcl" was set up for Luke and Charlie. Only one image of the
..    Rigid bicycle is shown, even though it was measured in two slightly
..    different configurations.
.. 
.. .. _secAccuracy:
.. 
.. Accuracy
.. --------
.. 
.. We here analyze the accuracy of the measurements of the parameters. Following
.. the lead of :cite:`Roland1971` error propagation theory was used to calculate
.. accuracy of the 25 benchmark parameters. This begins by estimating the standard
.. deviation of the actual measurements taken, see Section
.. :ref:`secBicycleMeasuredParameters`. The measurement error was chosen based on
.. the measuring tool and methods used. If :math:`x` is a parameter and is a
.. function of the measurements, :math:`u,v,\ldots`, which are Gaussian random
.. variables then :math:`x` is also a Gaussian random variable defined as
.. :math:`x=f(u,v,\ldots)`. The sample variance of :math:`x` is defined as
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: sampleVariance
.. 
..    s_x^2 =
..    \frac{1}{N-1}\sum^N_{i=1}
..    \left[(u_i - \bar{u})^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)^2 +
..    (v_i - \bar{v})^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)^2 +
..    2(u_i - \bar{u})(v_i - \bar{v})\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)
..    \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)
..    + \ldots\right]
.. 
.. Using the definitions for variance and covariance, Equation
.. :eq:`sampleVariance` can be simplified to
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: variance
.. 
..    s_x^2 = s_u^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)^2 +
..            s_v^2\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)^2 +
..            2s_{uv}\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\right)
..            \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)
..            + \ldots
.. 
.. If :math:`u` and :math:`v` are uncorrelated then :math:`s_{uv}=0`. Most of the
.. calculations hereafter have uncorrelated variables but a few do not and the
.. covariance has to be taken into account. Equation :eq:`variance` can be used to
.. calculate the variance of all types of functions. I made use of the Python
.. package `uncertainties <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncertainties/>`_
.. :cite:`Lebigot2010` to simplify the book keeping of the correlations and
.. variance calculations, thus some of the equations for the error are not shown
.. in the following sections.
.. 
.. .. _secGeometry:
.. 
.. Geometry
.. --------
.. 
.. The geometry measurements of the Delft bicycles focused on measuring the
.. benchmark parameters: trail, wheelbase, and steer axis tilt as directly as
.. possible. I also present an alternative method for the geometry used with the
.. Davis bicycles that attempts to measure the distances in my model derivation,
.. Chapter :ref:`eom`, which improves the accuracy of the parameters. Keep in
.. mind, that I assumed that the frame did not flex and that the wheel radii do
.. not change with rider weight when taking geometric measurements.
.. 
.. .. _secWheelRadii:
.. 
.. Wheel Radii
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~
.. 
.. The radii of the front :math:`r_\mathrm{F}` and rear :math:`r_\mathrm{R}`
.. wheels were estimated by measuring the linear distance traversed along the
.. ground through at least ten rotations of the wheel. Each wheel traversal was
.. measured separately and the measurements were taken with rider seated on the
.. bicycle, except for the gyro bicycle which had no rider. A 72 kg rider sat on
.. the Delft bicycles and an 84 kg rider on the Davis instrumented bicycle
.. [#weight]_. A 30 meter tape measure (resolution: 2mm) was pulled tight and
.. taped on a flat level smooth floor for the Delft bicycles and for the Davis
.. bicycles we marked a 68 foot length on the floor and used a 1/16 inch
.. resolution ruler to measure the 6 to 15 inch distance past the 68 foot mark
.. where the rotation stopped. The tire was marked and aligned with the tape
.. measure :ref:`Figure 5.2<figTireChalk>`. The accuracy of the distance
.. measurement is approximately :math:`\pm0.01` meter. The tires were pumped to
.. the recommended inflation pressure before the measurements. The wheel radius is
.. calculated by
.. 
.. .. math::
..     :label: wheelRadius
.. 
..     r\pm\sigma_r=
..     \frac{d}{2\pi n}
..     \pm\left(\frac{\sigma_d}{2\pi n}\right)
.. 
.. where :math:`r` is the wheel radius, :math:`d`, is the traversal distance,
.. :math:`n`, is the number of rotations and :math:`\sigma` is the respective
.. standard deviation of the subscripted variable. I use subscripts :math:`F` and
.. :math:`R` from front and rear wheels, respectively, in the measurement tables
.. in Section :ref:`secBicycleMeasuredParameters`.
..

..    Wheel and tire with chalk mark aligned to the tape measure.
.. 
.. .. _secHeadtube:
.. 
.. Head Tube Angle
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. 
.. For the Delft Bicycles, the head tube angle was measured directly using an
.. electronic level, :ref:`Figure 5.3<figHeadTube>`. The bicycle frame was fixed
.. perpendicular to the ground, the steering angle was set to the nominal
.. position, tire pressures were at recommended levels, and the bicycle was
.. unloaded. The steer axis tilt :math:`\lambda` is the complement to the head
.. tube angle, :math:`\gamma`.
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqHeadTubeAngle
.. 
..    \lambda\pm\sigma_\lambda
..    =\frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}(90^{\circ}-\gamma)
..    \pm\left(\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}\right)\sigma_{\gamma}

..    The digital level set against the Yellow Bicycle's head tube.
.. 
.. .. _secTrail:
.. 
.. Trail
.. ~~~~~
.. 
.. The idealized trail is difficult to measure directly due to the fact that the
.. tire has a contact patch and there is no distinct contact point. Instead I
.. chose to measure the fork offset, :math:`f_o`, and compute the ideal trail. The
.. fork offset was measured by clamping the steer tube of the front fork into a
.. v-block on a flat table, :ref:`Figure 5.4<figForkOffset>`. For the Delft
.. bicycles, a ruler was used to measure the height of the center of the head tube
.. and the height of the center of the axle axis, and for the Davis bicycles we
.. made use of more accurate height gages. The fork blades were aligned such that
.. the axle axis was parallel to the table surface.
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqTrail
.. 
..    c=\frac{r_\mathrm{F}\sin{\lambda}-f_o}{\cos{\lambda}}
.. 
.. .. math::

.. .. _secWheelbase:
.. 
.. Wheelbase
.. ~~~~~~~~~
.. 
.. I measured the wheelbase directly with the bicycle in nominal configuration
.. described in Section :ref:`secHeadtube`. We used a tape measure to measure the
.. distance from one wheel axle center to the other.
.. 
.. Alternative Geometry Measurement Method
.. ---------------------------------------
.. 
.. The geometry for the bicycle model presented in Chapter:`eom` can almost be
.. measured directly. I used this method for the Davis Bicycles. The bicycle frame
.. is set on a granite measurement table such that the head tube is in a v-block
.. and parallel to the table surface and the bicycle frame is situated such that
.. the frame is perpendicular to the table surface, :ref:`Figure 5
.. <figAlternativeGeometry>`. The fork is rotated in the head tube such that the
.. fork blades curve upwards. Two dummy axles are fit into the front and rear
.. dropouts and the axles are ensured to be parallel to the table surface. The
.. height from the table surface to the top of each axle are recorded with a
.. height gage and the diameters of the axles are measured with a micrometer or
.. caliper.
.. 
.. .. _figAlternativeGeometry:
.. 
.. .. figure:: figures/physicalparameters/alternative-geometry.*
..    :align: center
..    :width: 2.7in
..    :target: _images/alternative-geometry.png
.. 
..    The actual measurements taken to compute the basic bicycle geometry.
.. 
.. These measurements can then be converted to the three essential bicycle
.. dimensions, :math:`d_1`, :math:`d_2`, :math:`d_3` described in Chapter
.. :ref:`eom`.
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: d1
.. 
..    d_1 = h_1 + h_2 - h_3 + \frac{\hat{d}_1 - \hat{d}_2}{2}
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: d3
.. 
..    d_3 = h_4 - h_5 + \frac{\hat{d}_4 - \hat{d}_3}{2}
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: d2
.. 
..    d_2 = \sqrt{\left(d + \frac{\hat{d}_2 + \hat{d}_3}{2}\right)^2 - (d_1 - d_2)^2}
.. 
.. The traditional :cite:`Meijaard2007` parameters can then be calculated. If
.. :math:`r_F` does not equal :math:`r_R` then the steer axis tilt cannot be
.. computed analytically as Equation :eq:`eqLambda`  holds.
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqLambda
.. 
..    \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) = \frac{r_F - r_R + d_2 \operatorname{cos}(\lambda)}{d_1 + d_3}
.. 
.. It is trivial to find the solution to Equation :eq:`eqLambda` numerically. If
.. :math:`r_F=r_R`, the solution for :math:`\lambda` is analytic.
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: lambdaEqualRadii
.. 
..    \lambda = \operatorname{arctan}\left(\frac{d_2}{d_1 + d_3}\right)
.. 
.. The wheelbase is
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqWheelbase
.. 
..     w = (d_1 + d_3) \operatorname{cos}(\lambda) + d_2 \operatorname{sin}(\lambda)
.. 
.. and trail is then computed with Equation :eq:`eqTrail`, realizing :math:`f_o = d_3`:
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqTrailD3
.. 
..     c = \frac{r_F \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) - d_3}{\operatorname{cos}(\lambda)}
.. 
.. .. _secMass:
.. 
.. Mass
.. ----
.. 
.. For the Delft bicycles, each of the four bicycle parts were measured using a
.. Molen 20 kilogram scale with a resolution of 20 grams, :ref:`Figure
.. 5.6<figMassScale>`. The accuracy was conservatively assumed to also be
.. :math:`\pm20` grams. Also, the total mass was measured using a spring scale
.. with a resolution of 100 grams. The total mass was only used for comparison
.. purposes, as it was not very accurate. The masses of the parts of the Davis
.. bicycles were measured with a digital scale with a resolution of 50 grams (A &
.. D FV-150k Industrial Scale).

.. 
.. Wheels
.. ~~~~~~
.. 
.. The centers of mass of the wheels were assumed to be at their geometrical
.. centers to comply with the Whipple model. This was also assumed for the
.. flywheel in the gyro bike.
.. 
.. .. _secRearFrameCoM:
.. 
.. Rear Frame
.. ~~~~~~~~~~
.. 
.. The rear frame bicycle configuration was hung in at least three orientations
.. through the assumed lateral plane of symmetry. I assumed that the frame was
.. laterally symmetric, complying with the Whipple model, thus reducing the need
.. to use a more complex three dimensional measurement setup. The frame could
.. rotate about a joint such that gravity aligned the center of mass with the
.. support rod axis. The orientation angle of the steer axis,
.. :math:`\alpha_\mathrm{B}`, see :ref:`Figure 5.7<figAngles>`, relative to the
.. earth was measured using a digital level (:math:`\pm0.2^{\circ}` accuracy),
.. :ref:`Figure 5.8<figPendulumAngle>`. A thin string was aligned with the pendulum
.. axis which passed by the frame. The horizontal distance :math:`a_\mathrm{B}`
.. between the rear axle and the string was measured by aligning a 1 mm resolution
.. ruler perpendicular to the string :ref:`Figure 5.9<figPendulumDistance>`. The
.. distance :math:`a_\mathrm{B}` was negative if the string fell to the right of
.. the rear axle and positive if it fell to the left of the rear axle, when
.. viewing the bicycle from the right side. These measurements allow for the
.. calculation of the center of mass location in the global reference frame.

..    oscillation.

.. 
.. Theoretically, the center of mass lies on each line but due to experimental
.. error, if there are more than two lines, the lines do not all cross at the same
.. point. Only two lines are required to calculate the center of mass of the
.. laterally symmetric frame, but more orientations increase the center of mass
.. measurement accuracy. The three lines are defined as
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqLine
.. 
..    z_{\mathrm{B}i}(x) = m_{\mathrm{B}i} x + b_{\mathrm{B}i}
.. 
.. The mass center location can be calculated by finding the intersection of pairs
.. of these three lines. Two approaches were used used to calculate the center of
.. mass. Intuition leads one to think that the center of mass may be the centroid
.. of the triangle made by the three intersecting lines. The centroid can be found
.. by calculating the intersection point of each pair of lines and then averaging
.. the three intersection points\ [#leastsquares]_.

.. Fork and Handlebar
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. 
.. The fork and handlebars are generally a bit trickier to hang in three different
.. orientations, :ref:`Figure 5.11<figStratosFork>`. Typically two angles can be

.. Inertia
.. -------
.. 
.. The moments of inertia of the wheels, rear frame, and fork (and handlebar) were
.. measured both by taking advantage of the assumed symmetry of the parts and by
.. hanging the parts as both compound and torsional pendulums while measuring
.. their periods of oscillation when perturbed at small angles. The rate of
.. oscillation was measured using a `Silicon Sensing CRS03 100 deg/s rate gyro
.. <http://www.siliconsensing.com/CRS03>`_ for the Delft bicycles and a `Silicon
.. Sensing CRS04 200 deg/s rate gyro <http://www.siliconsensing.com/CRS04>`_ for
.. the Davis bicycles. The rate gyros were sampled at 1000 hz with a `National
.. Instruments USB-6008 12 bit data acquisition unit
.. <http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/14604>`_ and at 500 hz with a
.. `National Instruments USB-6218 16 bit data acquisition unit
.. <http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/203092>`_, respectively, and
.. the Matlab data acquisition toolbox. The measurement durations were between 15
.. and 30 secs and each moment of inertia measurement was performed at least three
.. times. No extra care was taken to calibrate the rate gyro, maintain a constant
.. power source (i.e. the battery drains slowly), or account for drift because I
.. was only concerned with the period. The raw voltage signal was used to
.. determine the period of oscillation which is needed for the moment of inertia
.. calculations, :ref:`Figure 5.14<figVoltage>`.

.. The function Equation :eq:`eqDecayOs` was fit to the data using the least

.. 
.. Most of the data fit the damped oscillation function well with very light (and
.. potentially ignorable) damping. There were several instances in the Delft
.. experiments of beating-like phenomena for some of the parts at particular
.. orientations. Roland and Massing, :cite:`Roland1971`, also encountered this problem
.. and used a bearing to prevent the torsional pendulum from swinging.
.. :ref:`Figure 5.15<figBeating>` shows an example of the beating like phenomena. I
.. used Roland and Massing's solution to prevent this in the Davis measurements.

..    An example of the beating-like phenomena observed during less than 5% of
..    the Delft trials.
.. 
.. The physical phenomenon observed corresponding to data sets such as these
.. occurred when the bicycle frame or fork was perturbed torsionally. After being set
.. into motion, the torsional motion damped and a longitudinal swinging motion
.. increased. The motions alternated back and forth with neither ever reaching
.. zero. The frequencies of these motions were very close to one another and it
.. was not apparent how to dissect the two. We explored fitting to a function such as
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqnSumSines
.. 
..    y(t) = A\sin{(\omega_1 t)} + B\sin{(\omega_2 t + \phi)} + C
.. 
.. But the fit predicts that :math:`\omega_1` and :math:`\omega_2` are very
.. similar frequencies. There was no easy way to choose which of the two
.. :math:`\omega`'s was the one associated with the torsional oscillation. Some
.. work was done to model the torsional pendulum as a laterally flexible beam to
.. determine this, but we ended up assuming that the accuracy of the period
.. calculation would not improve enough for the effort required. The later
.. experiments simply prevented the swinging motion of the pendulum without
.. damping the torsional motion.
.. 
.. The period for a damped oscillation is
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqnPeriodDamped
.. 
..    T = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}\omega_n}
.. 
.. The uncertainty in the period, :math:`T`, can be determined from
.. the fit. First, the variance of the fit is calculated
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqnFitVariance
.. 
..    \sigma_y^2 =
..    \frac{1}{N-5}\sum_{i=1}^N(y_{mi}-\bar{y}_m)^2-(y_{pi}-\bar{y}_m)^2
.. 
.. The covariance matrix of the fit function can be formed
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqnCovariance
.. 
..    \mathbf{U} = \sigma_y^2\mathbf{H}^{-1}
.. 
.. where :math:`\mathbf{H}` is the Hessian [Hubbard1989b] of the fit function,
.. :eq:`eqDecayOs`. :math:`\mathbf{U}` is a :math:`5\times5` matrix with the
.. variances of each of the five fit parameters along the diagonal. The variance
.. of :math:`T` can be computed using the variance of :math:`\zeta` and
.. :math:`\omega`. It is important to note that the uncertainties in the period
.. are very low (:math:`<1e-4`) due to the high sample rate, even for the fits
.. with low :math:`r^2` values.
..

.. 
.. Torsional Pendulum
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. 
.. A torsional pendulum was used to measure all moments of inertia about axes in
.. the laterally symmetric plane of each of the wheels, fork and frame. The
.. pendulum is made up of a rigid mount, an upper clamp, a torsion rod, and
.. various lower clamps, :ref:`Figure 5.16<figFixture>` .
.. 
.. .. _figFixture:

.. 
..    The rigid pendulum fixture from the Delft experiments mounted to a concrete
..    column.
.. 
.. A mild steel rod was used as the torsion spring. Lightweight, relatively low
.. moment of inertia clamps were constructed that could fix the torsional rod to
.. the various bicycle parts. The moments of inertia of the clamps were neglected
.. [#clamps]_.
.. 
.. The torsional pendulum was calibrated using a rod with an easily computed, i.e.
.. "known", moment of inertia :ref:`Figure 5.17<figRod>`\ [#rod]_. A torsional
.. pendulum almost identical to the one used in :cite:`Kooijman2006` was used to
.. measure the average period :math:`\overline{T}_i` of oscillation of the rear
.. frame at three different orientation angles :math:`\beta_i`, where :math:`i=1`,
.. :math:`2`, :math:`3`, as shown in :ref:`Figure 5.10<figTriangle>`. The parts were
.. perturbed slightly, around 1 degree, and allowed to oscillate about the pendulum
.. axis through several periods. This was repeated at least three times for each
.. frame and the recorded periods were averaged.
.. 
.. .. _figRod:

.. 
..    The steel calibration rod. The moment of inertia of the rod, :math:`I_P =
..    \frac{m_P}{12}(3 r_P^2 + l_P^2)`, can be used to estimate the stiffness of
..    the torsional pendulum, :math:`k = \frac{4 I_P \pi^2}{\overline{T_P}^2}`.
.. 
.. Wheels
.. ~~~~~~
.. 
.. Estimating the full inertia tensors of the wheels is less complex because the
.. wheels are assumed symmetric about three orthogonal planes making all products
.. of inertia zero. The :math:`I_{xx}=I_{zz}` moments of inertia were calculated
.. by measuring the averaged period of oscillation about an axis in the
.. :math:`XZ_B`-plane using the torsional pendulum setup and Equation
.. :eq:`eqTorPend`. The wheels are also assumed to be laterally symmetric about
.. any radial axis. Thus only two moments of inertia are required for the set of
.. benchmark parameters :cite:`Meijaard2007`. The moment of inertia about the axle was
.. measured by hanging the wheel as a compound pendulum, :ref:`Figure
.. 5.18<figWheelIyy>`. The wheel was hung on a horizontal rod and perturbed to
.. oscillate about the axis of the rod. The rate gyro was attached to the spokes
.. near the hub\ [#gyroloc]_ and oriented mostly along the axle axis. The wheels
.. for the Delft bicycles would rotate at the rod contact point about the vertical
.. axis which added a very low frequency component of rate along the vertical
.. radial axis, but this should have little effect on the period estimation about
.. the compound pendulum axis. A fixture was designed for the Davis bicycles that
.. prevented undesired rotation. The pendulum length is the distance from the
.. rod/rim contact point to the mass center of the wheel\ [#compoundrod]_. The
.. inner diameter of the rim was measured and divided by two to get
.. :math:`l_\mathrm{F,R}`. The moment of inertia about the axle is calculated from
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqCompoundInertia

..    I_{\mathrm{F,R}yy} = \left(\frac{\bar{T}_\mathrm{F,R}}{2\pi}\right)^2

.. 
.. The radial moment of inertia was measured by hanging the wheel as a torsional

.. that the center of mass aligned with the torsional pendulum axis and then the
.. clamp secured. The wheel was then perturbed and oscillated about the vertical
.. pendulum axis. The radial moment of inertia can be calculated with
.. 
.. .. math::

.. Frame
.. ~~~~~
.. 
.. At least three measurements were made to estimate the locally level moments and
.. products of inertia (:math:`I_{\mathrm{B}xx}`, :math:`I_{\mathrm{B}xz}`, and
.. :math:`I_{\mathrm{B}zz}`) of the rear frame in the nominal configuration. The
.. rear frame was typically hung from either the three main tubes (seat tube, down
.. tube, and top tube), the seat post, or a small fixture mounted to the brake
.. mounts :ref:`Figure 5.8<figPendulumAngle>`. The rear fender prevented easy
.. connection to the seat tube on some of the bikes and the clamp was attached to
.. the fender. The fender was less rigid than the frame tube. For best accuracy
.. with only three orientation angles, the frame should be hung at three angles
.. that are :math:`120^\circ` apart. Attaching by the three tubes on the frame
.. generally provide that the orientation angles were spread evenly at about
.. :math:`120^\circ`. Furthermore, taking data at more orientation angles improved
.. the accuracy and was generally possible with standard diamond frame bicycles.
.. 
.. Three moments of inertia :math:`J_{\mathrm{B}i}` about the pendulum axes were
.. calculated using
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqTorPend
.. 
..    J_{\mathrm{B}i} = \frac{k \overline{T}_{\mathrm{B}i}^2}{4\pi^2}
.. 
.. The moments and products of inertia of the rear frame and handlebar/fork
.. assembly with reference to the benchmark coordinate system were calculated by
.. formulating the relationship between the rotated inertial frames
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqRotIn
.. 
..    \mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{B}i} = \mathbf{R}_i \mathbf{I}_\mathrm{B} \mathbf{R}_i^T
.. 
.. where :math:`\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{B}i}` is the inertia tensor about the pendulum
.. reference frame, :math:`\mathbf{I}_\mathrm{B}` is the inertia tensor in the
.. locally level reference frame, and :math:`\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{B}i}` is the
.. rotation matrix relating the two frames, :ref:`Figure 5.7<figAngles>`. The
.. planar inertia tensor is defined as
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqMoI
.. 
..    \mathbf{I}_\mathrm{B}=
..    \begin{bmatrix}
..      I_{\mathrm{B}xx}  & I_{\mathrm{B}xz}\\
..      I_{\mathrm{B}xz} & I_{\mathrm{B}zz}
..    \end{bmatrix}
.. 
.. The inertia tensor can be reduced to a :math:`2 \times 2` matrix because the
.. frame is assumed to be laterally symmetric and the :math:`Y` axis of the
.. pendulum reference is the same as the :math:`Y` axis of the benchmark reference
.. frame. The simple rotation matrix about the :math:`Y`-axis can similarly be
.. reduced to a :math:`2 \times 2` matrix where :math:`s_{\beta i}` and
.. :math:`c_{\beta i}` are defined as :math:`\sin{\beta_i}` and
.. :math:`\cos{\beta_i}`, respectively.
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqRotMat
.. 
..    \mathbf{R}=
..    \begin{bmatrix}
..      c_{\beta i} & -s_{\beta i}\\
..      s_{\beta i} & c_{\beta i}
..    \end{bmatrix}
.. 
.. The first entry of :math:`\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{B}i}` in Equation :eq:`eqRotIn`
.. is the moment of inertia about the pendulum axis and is written explicitly as
.. 
.. .. math::
..    :label: eqInRelComp
.. 
..    J_{\mathrm{B}i} = c^{2}_{\beta i}I_{\mathrm{B}xx} -
..    2s_{\beta i}c_{\beta i}I_{\mathrm{B}xz} +
..    s^{2}_{\beta i}I_{\mathrm{B}zz}
.. 
.. 
.. and the moments of inertia can be solved as a linear system or with least
.. squares if it is over determined. The inertia of the frame about an axis normal
.. to the plane of symmetry was estimated by hanging the frame as a compound
.. pendulum about the wheel axis, :ref:`Figure 5.20<figFrameCompound>`. Equation
.. :eq:`eqCompoundInertia` is used but with the mass of the frame and the frame
.. pendulum length.

.. Fork and handlebar
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. 
.. The inertia of the fork and handlebar is calculated in the same way as the
.. frame. The fork is hung as both a torsional pendulum, :ref:`Figure
.. 5.11<figStratosFork>`, and as a compound pendulum, :ref:`Figure
.. 5.21<figForkCompound>`. The fork provides fewer mounting options to obtain at
.. least three equally spaced orientation angles, especially if there is no
.. fender. We designed a connection to the brake mounts for the Davis bicycles to
.. remedy that. The torsional calculations follow equations :eq:`eqTorPend`
.. through :eq:`eqInRel` and the compound pendulum calculations is calculated with

.. Human Parameters
.. ================
.. 
.. To properly model the bicycle rider system it is necessary to estimate the
.. physical parameters of the bicycle rider. The measurement of the physical
.. properties of a human is more difficult than for a bicycle because the human
.. body parts are not as easily described as rigid bodes with defined joints and
.. due to flexible geometry, daily varying mass, wobbly mass, etc.
.. 
.. Human mass, center of mass, and inertial properties have been measured and
.. estimated in a multitude of ways. Each method has its advantages and
.. disadvantages. Many methods exist including cadaver measurements
.. (:cite:`Dempster1955`, :cite:`Clauser1969`, :cite:`Chandler1975`),
.. photogrammetry, ray scanning techniques (:cite:`Zatsiorsky1983`,
.. :cite:`Zatsiorsky1990`), water displacement (:cite:`Park1999`), rotating
.. platforms (:cite:`Griffiths2005`), and geometrical estimation of the body
.. segments (:cite:`Yeadon1990a`). :cite:`Dohring1953`, :cite:`Eaton1973`, and
.. :cite:`Patterson2004` measured the moments of inertia and centers of mass of a
.. combined rider and vehicle, but this is not always practical especially if the
.. properties of multiple riders are desired.
.. 
.. I approached the human parameter estimation in a more analytical fashion based
.. primarily on geometric measurements much like Yeadon. Both methods that were
.. used were based on estimating the inertial parameters from mass and geometry
.. measurement along with a human body density estimate. With the first method, I
.. estimated the physical properties of the rider in a seated position using a
.. simple mathematical geometrical estimation similar in idea to
.. :cite:`Yeadon1990a` in combination with mass data from :cite:`Dempster1955`.
.. The second method substitutes Yeadon's more robust model with my previous one.
.. 
.. Simple Geometry Method
.. ----------------------
.. 
.. This method calculates the center of mass and inertia of a simplified model of
.. the ten major human body parts: head, torso, upper and lower arms, and upper
.. and lower legs, in a general configuration for sitting on typical bicycles. The
.. mass of the rider was measured along with fourteen anthropometric measurements
.. of the body. These measurements in combination with the geometrical bicycle
.. measurements taken in the previous section (:ref:`secBicycleParameters`) and
.. several additional bicycle geometrical measurements are used to define a model
.. of the rider made up of simple geometrical shapes (:ref:`Figure
.. 5.22<figMooreModel>`). The legs and arms are represented by cylinders, the
.. torso by a cuboid and the head by a sphere. The feet are positioned at the
.. center of the bottom bracket axis to maintain symmetry about the
.. :math:`XZ`-plane.

..    :target: _images/moore-model.png
.. 
..    Locations of grid points and simple geometric shapes of the simple geometric
..    inertia model.
.. 
.. All but one of the anthropomorphic measurements are taken when the rider was
.. standing casually on flat ground. The lower leg length :math:`l_{ll}` is the
.. distance from the floor to the knee joint. The upper leg length :math:`l_{ul}`
.. is the distance from the knee joint to the hip joint. The length from hip to
.. hip :math:`l_{hh}` and shoulder to shoulder :math:`l_{ss}` are the distances
.. between the two hip joints and two shoulder joints, respectively. The torso
.. length :math:`l_{to}` is the distance between hip joints and shoulder joints.
.. The upper arm length :math:`l_{ua}` is the distance between the shoulder and
.. elbow joints. The lower arm length :math:`l_{al}` is the distance from the
.. elbow joint to the center of the hand when the arm is outstretched. The
.. circumferences are taken at the cross section of maximum circumference (e.g.
.. around the bicep, around the brow, over the nipples for the chest). The final
.. dimension is taken while the rider is seated on the bicycle in a normal riding
.. position. The forward lean angle :math:`\lambda_{fl}` is the approximate angle
.. made between the floor (:math:`XY`-plane) and the line connecting the center of
.. the rider's head and the top of the seat. This was estimated by taking a side
.. profile photograph of the rider on the bicycle and scribing a line from the
.. center of the head to the top of the seat. The measurements were made as
.. accurately as possible with basic tools but no special attention is given
.. further to the accuracy of the calculations due to the fact that modeling the
.. human as basic geometric shapes already introduces an unknown error.
.. 
.. I measured twelve additional geometric values (only five of which are needed
.. for this setup\ [#f1]_) to assist in configuring the rider to the be seated on
.. the bicycle, :ref:`Figure 5.23<figBatavusBrowserDim>`.

..    bottom bracket to the center of the rear wheel.
.. :math:`l_{sp}`, Seat post length
..    The distance from the intersection of a horizontal top tube and the seat
..    tube to the top of the seat. Measured along the center line of the seat
..    post.

..    The distance from the bottom bracket to the point at which a horizontal top
..    tube would intersect the seat tube.

.. Yeadon method
.. -------------
.. 
.. The :cite:`Yeadon1990a` human inertial model was developed for estimating the
.. inertial parameters needed to describe a human model for complex gymnastic
.. maneuvers. It is essentially a more complete and accurate method than the one
.. previously presented. There are 95 geometrical measurements of the human and a
.. single mass measurement for scaling the body part densities. Yeadon makes use
.. of stadium solids and a single semi-ellipse to more accurately model the human
.. geometry. Two apparent deficiencies are the fact that too much detail is taken
.. for body parts that have less inertia (i.e. the hands/feet) and at large
.. configuration angles for some joints, the inertia is poorly modeled (e.g. the
.. buttocks disappears when the human in a seated position). The model also does not
.. have full freedom at each joint. Refer to :cite:`Yeadon1990a` for a complete
.. description of the model.
.. 
.. Once the inertia of each segment in the Yeadon model is computed, the joint
.. angles must be set. We set the somersault angle to match the forward lean angle
.. as described in the previous section. We then measure three additional bicycle
.. dimensions to assist in the configuration of the rider. They are as follows:
.. 
.. :math:`w_{hb}`, Handlebar width
..    The lateral distance between the points the hands hold the handlebars.
.. :math:`l_{hbR}`, Rear hub to handlebar.
..    The distance from the center of the rear hub to the point on the handlebar
..    where the hand grips.
.. :math:`l_{hbF}`, Front hub to handlebar.
..    The distance from the center of the front hub to the point on the handlebar
..    where the hand grips.
.. 
.. We locate the hip center (Ls0) at the top of the bicycle seat and the
.. somersault joint angle is set such that the torso (P, T, C) aligned by the
.. forward lean angle :math:`\lambda_{fl}`.
.. 
.. The basic process for setting the elbow elevation angle is to find the distance
.. between the shoulder (La0, Lb0) and the handlebar grip. The handlebar grip
.. location is at the point at which the lateral line with length
.. :math:`\frac{w_{hb}}{2}` intersects the circle formed by the intersection of
.. the two spheres which are centered at the front and rear wheel centers with
.. radii :math:`l_{hbF}` and :math:`l_{hbR}`, respectively. The elevation angle of
.. the elbow then is defined as the angle at which the distance from the shoulder
.. (La0, Lb0) to the knuckle (La6, Lb6) is equal to the distance from the shoulder
.. (La0, Lb0) to the handlebar grip. We then assume that the shoulder rotation
.. angle is zero and find the shoulder elevation and abduction angles which force
.. the vector from the shoulder to the knuckle to equal the vector from the
.. shoulder to the handlebar grip.
.. 
.. The thigh and knee elevation angles are set such that the center of the heel
.. level (Lj6, Lk6) is aligned with the bottom bracket axis and that both the
.. thigh abduction and rotation angles are zero. We assume that the foot peg is
.. located at the bottom bracket center and is the same lateral distance from the
.. sagittal plane as the hip centers. The knee and thigh elevation angles are then
.. found in the same fashion as the elbow and shoulder angles, which the lesser
.. restriction that the thigh abduction angle is zero.
.. 
.. :ref:`Figure 5.24<figHuman>` shows a visualization of the Yeadon model when
.. configured to sit on a bicycle. The details of the calculations and all of the
.. data is included with the Yeadon :cite:`Dembia2011` and BicycleParameters

.. 
.. Bicycle-Rider Parameters
.. ========================
.. 
.. Once both the bicycle and rider parameters are known, the parameter for various
.. systems can be extracted. The simplest is that the rider is rigidly attached to
.. the frame. The parallel axis theorem allows one to calculate the combined
.. inertia of the bicycle frame and the rigid rider. Both of the rider
.. formulations also allow one to segment the body for more complex rider models
.. with multiple degrees of freedom. For example, the inertia for a leaning
.. rider's upper body can be determined separately and the legs can be fixed in
.. the bicycle frame. We make use of this for the different rider biomechanical
.. models presented in Chapter :ref:`extensions`.
.. 
.. Software Implementation
.. =======================
.. 
.. The bicycle parameter calculation and the Yeadon method have been implemented
.. in two open source software packages written in the Python language, called
.. `yeadon <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yeadon>`_ :cite:`Dembia2011` and
.. `BicycleParameters <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/BicycleParameters>`_
.. :cite:`Moore2011a`. The Yeadon package uses geometric measurements and joint
.. configuration angles to output the total inertia properties of the human in an
.. arbitrary reference frame. It also can provide inertial properties of
.. individual body segments or combinations of body segments. It is suitable for a
.. wide variety of human dynamic models. The BicycleParameters package accepts
.. either the raw measurements described in Section :ref:`secBicycleParameters` or
.. the benchmark parameterization :cite:`Meijaard2007` and computes the benchmark
.. bicycle parameters. It makes use of the Yeadon package to allow one to
.. configure riders in a seated position on the bicycle and outputs the inertial
.. properties of the bicycle/rider system. Overall it allows one to provide values
.. and uncertainties for all of the raw measurements as described in both the
.. Bicycle and Yeadon parameter sections and compute the parameters for the
.. Whipple Bicycle model. Details of use of the software can be found in the
.. documentation for each of the packages: `<http://packages.python.org/yeadon>`_,
.. `<http://packages.python.org/BicycleParameters>`_.

.. physical parameters (Tables :ref:`5.9<tabBatavusBenchmark>` to
.. :ref:`5.12<tabDavisBenchmark>`) of the ten bicycles are given in the following

.. .. [#weight] This is actually the same rider: I gained some weight after
..    drinking all that good beer in the Netherlands!
.. 
.. .. [#leastsquares] Alternatively, the three lines can be treated as an over
..    determined linear system and the least squares method used to find a
..    unique solution. This solution is not the same as the triangle centroid
..    method. The solution with the higher accuracy would be the preferred
..    one.
.. 
.. .. [#steertorque] See Chapter :ref:`davisbicycle`.
.. 
.. .. [#clamps] The Davis clamp was a bit larger relative to forks with no
..    handlebars. This may have decreased the accuracy of the related measurements.
.. 
.. .. [#gyroloc] The gyro should have been attached as close to the pivot point as
..    possible to minimize additional inertia, but the weight of the gyro is still
..    quite negligible.
.. 
.. .. [#compoundrod] I should have used a edge rather than a rod for the pivot, as
..    the period for a pendulum about a point contact edge is different than that
..    about a rod of non-negligble diameter. The radius of this rod was about 3 mm
..    which is neglible to the pendulum length of about 300 mm.
.. 
.. .. [#f1] These dimensions are not necessary for the provided methods, but are
..    necessary to build the grid point system. Early on they were used to
..    analytically estimate the inertia of the bicycle frame. See :cite:`Moore2008`
