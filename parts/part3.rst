We have seen previously that the actin cytoskeleton play a major role in
cellular mechanics in many domains. It is necessary for force generation, and a
key component to cell motility. It has also be extensively studied both in
cells and biomimetic systems. 

Actin can for a variety of network in cell, ranging from dense branch network
at the leading Edge of the lamelipodia to bundled parallel structure forming
the filopodia.  Reconstruction of actin network have been done in biomimetic
systems using purified component, and many properties of these network have
been measured.

It has been determined that the actin cortex is  a mechanical support for the
plasma membrane and that it extend over a few hundreds of nanometers. Many
cells processes also hint for actin structure connected to this cortex that are
key elements to organelle and chromosome positioning. 

In this part of the manuscript we investigate how a sparse actin structure can
emanate from the actin cortex, and what its properties are. Using a biomimetic
system to reconstitute the actin cortex and its dendritic structure on bead, we
show that from the cortex emanate a network of filaments that have mechanical
effect up to tens of micrometers from the actin cortex.

The branched structure of the actin cortex underneath the plasma membrane of of
cell hint for a structure governed by Arp2/3. How Arp2/3 and CP can be used to
form a biomimetic actin cortex has been studied. In :cite:`Kawska2012`, both in
vitro measurement on reconstituted actin cortex on bead as well as simulation
investigate the effect of cross linking and capping on the formed gel. They can
see both experimentally ad in simulation that a network of filament escape from
what is defined as the active cortex. The effect of these long filament is not
take into account in the in-silica system where measurement is restricted to
filament shorter than 10 µm. Only the effect of dense entangle actin network
generated from primers randomly placed  on the bead surface participate in the
increase of tension and contribute to symmetry breaking.

The limit of the dense network visible in epifluorescence is defined in
:cite:`Kawska2012` by the position of the half-maximum fluorescent intensity.
The properties of these network are measured by :cite:`Pujol2012` using
magnetic beads after stabilising with phalloidin. Though they do not
investigate the sparse and softer actin network that originate from he visible
part.


Using :ref:`time-shared optical tweezer <time_shared_ot>` we are able to probe
the mechanics of this soft actin structure at time scale than actin
polymerisation and pN force range. We show that the beyond the dense dendritic
mimicking the actin cortex which as been measured to have :ref:`Elastic Modulus
<elastic_modulus>` in the order of kPa :cite:`Pujol2012` the soft actin cloud
we probe is much softer with stiffness around 3 order of magnitude smaller.
This might explain why such a structure as not previously been seen by less
sensitive techniques. Nonetheless the size of this actin cloud and its ability
to sustain forces suggest that in cell the actin cortex is not sharply
delimited and that structure escaping from it have a role in organelle
positioning.


How does the external part of the gel which is below the half fluorescent intensity behave ? What are its mechanical properties ?  How does it change through time ?
