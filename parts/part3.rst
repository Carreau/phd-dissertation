We have seen previously that the actin cytoskeleton play a major role in cellular mechanics.
    - force generation
    - cell motility
    - extensively studied

Actin can form different type of networks.  Reconstruction of actin network
have been done in biomimetic systems using purified components. And many
mechanical properties have been measured.

Effect of the actin cortex, support mechanically the plasma membrane, it is
supposed to extend over a few hundreds on nm and actin structure connected to
the cortex seem to be key el element into organelle positioning, mvt of
chromosomes.

We investigate how such actin network are connected to the actin cortex or
could be directly extension of the actin cortex.

Branched structure in the cortex hint for Arp2/3.

How arp2/3  and Cp form the actin cortex has been studied in Kawska2012 and can
be reproduced on the surface of bead.  In kawska they form an actin cortex,
description nucleation tree that inter entangle, simulation, do not take into
account escaping branches, and  define the thickness of gel as half
fluorescence. This actin gel is also studied by Pujol/heuving, but stabilized by phaloidine and compressed by magnetic bead. Range of force really high.

In this part we are interested in the following : 


How does the external part of the gel which is below the half fluorescent intensity behave ? What are its mechanical properties ?  How does it change through time ? 
if the gel is elastic or
