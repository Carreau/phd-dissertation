Dependencies
============

I've attempted to generate all of the figures and tables\ [#all]_ in the
dissertation from raw data and scripts. They can be generated by running all of
the scripts in the ``src`` directory. These scripts require several Python,
Matlab, and R based software. The dependencies follow.

- Matlab Simulink 7.5
- Matlab Control System Toolbox 8.5
- Matlab System Identification Toolbox 7.4

.. note:: Older and newer versions of Matlab and the toolboxes may work, I've
   only tested the code with these versions.

Python Development Dependencies
-------------------------------

These are all of the Python packages we've developed for the analysis in the
dissertation.

- AutolevToolKit
  [`src <https://github.com/moorepants/AutolevToolKit>_`]
- DynamicistToolKit
  [`src <https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit>_`]

Matlab Development Dependencies
-------------------------------

These are the Matlab packages we've developed.

- HumanControl
  [`src <https://github.com/moorepants/HumanControl>`]
- BicycleSystemID
  [`src <https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleSystemID>`]

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

My workflow also includes these tools but they are not neccessary to build the
dissertation.

- git (http://git-scm.com/)
- pip (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip): Useful for pulling releases from PyPi.
- virtualenv (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
- Autolev 4.1 (http://www.autolev.com/): This software is no longer available,
  but can be used to process the ``.al`` scritps.

Installation
============

Install main Python dependencies to the system. It is easiest to simply use
your system's package manager (e.g. apt-get) to install all of the dependcies.

::

   apt-get install git python-setuptools python-virtualenv python-numpy python-scipy ipython python-matplotlib python-pandas python-sphinx python-tables python-uncertainties

.. warning:: The package manager may not have the lastest software versions, so
   you may have to build from source or locate the correct binaries.

To install packages from source use ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` or  download
the tar balls and use ``python setup.py install``.

::

   $ apt-get install python-pip

Create a directory to house all of the software.

::

   $ mkdir bicycle-dissertation

Clone all of the python packages developed by us (if you use Github, you should
fork the code in the web interface and then clone from your fork, for easy pull
requests).

::

   $ cd bicycle-dissertation
   $ git clone git://github.com/moorepants/dissertation.git
   $ git clone git://github.com/moorepants/AutolevToolKit.git
   $ git clone git://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit.git
   $ git clone git://github.com/moorepants/BicycleParameters.git
   $ git clone git://github.com/moorepants/BicycleDataProcessor.git
   $ git clone git://github.com/moorepants/CanonicalID.git
   $ git clone git://github.com/moorepants/BicycleID.git
   $ git clone git://github.com/fitze/yeadon.git

I typcially set up a virtual environment for the Python development workflow.
I usaually install the  main Python dependencies to the system files as they
are typically used by other environments, but it is possible to install them in
the virtual environment which is a good idea if you need to pin the versions.
The virtual enviroment is not required but is recommended if you are hacking on
the development dependencies.

::

   $ # --system-site-packages allows use of packages installed to the system
   $ virtualenv --system-site-packages bicycle

Activate the virtual environment.

::

   $ source bicycle/bin/activate

Checkout the dissertation tag in each of the repos. The dissertation tag pins
the software used when version 1.0 of the disseration was built, but future
versions of each may work too (if I keep things backward compatible).

For example::

   $ cd AutolevToolKit
   $ git checkout dissertation

Then install::

   python setup.py install

or::

   python setup.py develop # do this if hacking on the code

::

   $ cd ..

Repeat for all six Python repositories.

Matlab Install
==============

Clone the two repositories in the ``bicycle-dissertation`` directory.

::

   $ git clone git://github.com/moorepants/HumanControl.git
   $ git clone git://github.com/moorepants/BicycleSystemID.git

Data
====

The scripts access several sets of data.

- Physical Parameters: The ``data`` directory in the ``BicycleParameters``
  repository has the necessary data to load in the bicycles and riders.
- The Davis bicycle run database can be downloaded here
  http://mae.ucdavis.edu/~biosport/InstrumentedBicycleData/InstrumentedBicycleData.h5.bz2 [310mb].
  To build from raw data files see the ``BicycleDataProcessor`` readme.
- The dissertation data and pre-generated figures can be downloaded here:
  http://mae.ucdavis.edu/~biosport/jkm/dissertation/dissertation-data.tar.bz2
  The folders should be extracted into the ``dissertation`` directory.

Paths
=====

This is an absolute mess so far. A lot of the scripts have explicit paths to
the data files which are referenced to my file system. They will have to be
manually changed to reflect the locations on the system.

Generate Figures and Tables
===========================

At this point the figures and tables can be generated by running all of the
scripts in the ``src`` directory. The figures and tables are all stored in the
``figures`` and ``tables`` directory and most are autogenerated with the source
code in the ``src`` directory and data stored in the ``data`` directory.

Sphinx Build Details
====================

This document was built with Sphinx 1.1.3. It makes use of three extensions two
of which are part of Sphinx (sphinx.ext.todo, sphinx.ext.mathjax) and one which
is a custom extension for incorporating bibliographic data from a bibtex
database (sphinxcontrib.bibtex). The latest development version of
``sphinxcontrib.bibtex`` should be used along with the latest development
version of ``pybtex`` and these two un-merged branches:

- lp:~matthias-troffaes/pybtex/label-alpha
- lp:~matthias-troffaes/pybtex/sorting-bugfix

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#all] Most of the figures are generated by the source but some are not.
