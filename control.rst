Introduction
============

I have shown that a basic bicycle model can demonstrate stability when
linearized about the nominal configuration for ranges of speeds. This stablity
is a strong function of the parameters of the bicycle and it turns out that for
general bicycle designs, they exhibit stability. I've also shown that stability
can be enhanced or defeated by extending the Whipple model with things such as
the a flywheel or rider degrees of freedom. I've also examined the kinematics
of the rider to see if the rider attempts to control the bicycle at the
eigenfrequencies of the Whipple model, and this doesn't seem to be the case. As
far as roll stability is concerned, it is highly probable that a human must
enact active control at all times while balancing a bicycle, but the stablity
exhibited by the Whipple model may allieviate the control needed by the rider.

Review of manual control
========================

Isn't it true that the crossover model is only a representation of human behavior near the limit of performance?

 I can describe the dynamics of the human at various "crossover" frequencies
 and various performance levels.  It's true, that it has been verified in many
 laboratory and vehicle control tasks were good performance was required.
