Introduction
============

I have shown that a basic bicycle model can exhibit stability when linearized
about the nominal configuration for a range of speeds, Chapter :ref:`eom`.
Stability is a strong function of the parameters of the bicycle and it turns
out that for standard bicycle designs, they typically exhibit a speed dependent
stability where the bicycle becomes stable at some speed threshold, Chapter
:ref:`parameterstudy`. Based on the damping of the weave mode, one may also
even claim that the bicycle becomes *more* stable as speed increases,
neglecting the very slow easily controllable capsize instability. I've also
shown that stability can be enhanced or defeated by extending the Whipple model
with a flywheel or rider degrees of freedom, Chapter :ref:`extensions`. In
Chapter :ref:`motioncapture`, I've examined the kinematics of the rider to see
if the rider's motion during a control task has any correlation to the
kinematics of the Whipple model and identified the dominant rider motions
during stabilization.

As far as roll stability is concerned, it is highly probable that a human must
enact active control at *all* times while balancing. I reason this, because the
bicycle's roll angle responds to the human's postural control. But the
stability exhibited of the almost always present weave mode may alleviate the
need for primary roll control provided by the rider. And even if the
bicycle-rider system is open loop unstable at a given speed, the question
arises of *how* instable is it or *how* controllable is it. Classic
controllability is simply a binary test to determine whether or not it is
possible for a system to be controlled, whereas there must be some measure
variable measure of controllability that is more relevant to the proposed
questions. [Seffen2001]_ studies how parameter changes affect controllability,
and comes up with rideability index. [Schwab2010a]_ and [Schwav2012]_ also
determines the controllability of several bicycle models and uses the eigenmode
rate magnitude as an example variable measure of the controllability. The pole
locations of an open loop system can also give a general sense of how easy it
is to control with roots in the far right plane likely being hard to stabilize.

One can work with different bicycle models (simple/complex [or low/high order]
and linear/non-linear), different control structures, and different ways to
identify the optimal numerical values for the controller. For a given order
model most good controllers can place the closed loop poles in the same place
regardless of the control structure. Controllers designed for low order or
linear models are even likely to work with higher order models and non-linear
models. But the controller structure design provides different views into the
feedback mechanisms at work. For the human controller, these structures may or
may not may well to the human's physiological and neurological system. The human
has to choose his control actions to balance our robustness and performance.

The bicycle-rider system presents both a theoretical and experimentally rich
dynamical system for control studies. It is very tractable in the sense that
most people are familiar with controlling a bicycle and that it is a *simple*
machine which is readily available for experimental use. And thirdly, control
of the bicycle is not necessarily trivial due to it's complex dynamics and
provides a platform for testing many strategies. Past control studies tend to
be framed in two different but overlapping frameworks. The first is to simply
control a bicycle (model or real) with any control algorithms and mechanisms
available. Both the simple roll stabilization task and more complex path
tracking tasks have been examined. The results show that bicycles are readily
controllable by a variety of means, from a simple steer in the direction of the
rate of fall to full state feedback with preview of future path variations.
Depending on the sensing and actuation methods chosen these controllers range
in their resemblance to how a human may actually control a bicycle. This leads
into a second framework in which the researcher is explicitly trying to
determine the how a human balances and controls a bicycle. Basic understanding
of the limited sensory input and actuation available to a human give
constraints on what control structures are adopted. Both frameworks are
motivated by many things such as desire for to implement automatic control,
improving simulation for vehicle design, handling qualities inquiries, control
system testing, etc.

My intention of the work presented in this dissertation falls in the second
framework, where we are most concerned with identifying the human controller.
The first part gives an overview of other non-human based single track vehicle
control efforts, followed by some simple control examples. I follow this with a
review on human based control design and finish up with some addendum material
to our paper [Hess2012]_ which details the controller design we developed to
represent the human.

Ideal Control Models
====================

Once you dig around in the literature enough you will find many studies on the
control of a single track vehicles. The following provides a light review of
much of the literature which focus on *ideal* controller for single track
vehicles. I use the word ideal to simply label control design which is not
explicitly focused on the human operator control. I've split the review of
control models into two sections. The first are about controllers which have
actually be implemented, or attempted implementation, on robotic vehicles. The
second are theoretic controllers that weren't necessarily introduced to
identify the human control system. The following section section details
efforts that explicitly work with controllers that mimic or try to understand
the human controller.

But one quick aside, :ref:`Figure 1 <figPubs>` shows a histogram by year of the
all the references I've collected in the course of this project. It is
interesting to note the explosion in the early seventies that probably
coincides with the bicycle boom and the digital computer age. We've also had a
boom in the last decade, with research interests growing. This may coincide
with the microcontroller advances and potentially some from the growth in
bicycling.

Robot Control
-------------

[Zytveld1975]_
   van Zytveld was one of the first to explore the automatic stabilization of
   the single track vehicle that was not explicitly in the human control
   framework, although he did chose feedback variables that he believed a human
   rider could sense. He attempted to control a robot bicycle with only a
   leaning rider (inverted pendulum) through proportional and derivative
   feedback of rider lean angle and bicycle roll angle. He made use of a linear
   model with a rider lean degree of freedom which is fundamentally the same as
   the one presented Chapter :ref:`extensions`. His controller worked on paper,
   but he wasn't able to ever balance the robot bicycle, with the suspected
   problems being the limitations of the hardware he used.
[Nagai1983]_
   They constructed a robot bicycle which balanced and tracked itself by
   feeding back lateral deviation at a previewed time and the current roll
   angle. He was successful at stabilizing his robot. His bicycle model was
   much simpler than the Whipple model but he found good agreement between
   experiment and the his model predictions, with the exception of
   counter-steer predictions.
[Berriah1999]_
   They developed a digital fuzzy controller to stabilize a remote controlled
   bicycle robot. They do not seem to demonstrate the robot actually balancing
   but only bench tests of the sensors and actuators.
[Gallaspy2000]_
   He designed a robot balancing bicycle which controls a gimbaled gyroscope to
   apply a restoring torque with respect to the sensed roll angle, but was not
   successful at balancing the real robot.
[Miyagishi2003]_, [Kageyama200]_, [Miyagishi2006]_
   These two papers, among others, detail work on a Honda motorcycle robot, of
   which they say the controller is modeled after a human. The video
   demonstrations of this vehicle indicate that it may be the most manually
   realistically controlled robot there is, not mention that is seems to work
   really well.  Most of these papers are in Japanese and I've had trouble
   finding others, so I cannot comment on the details.
[Tanaka2004]_
   They successfully balances a bicycle on rollers with a PD roll angle to
   steer angle controller with a disturbance observer.
[Iuchi2005]_
   They use PD control on the bicycle roll angle to control steer angle and
   rider lean angle. The controller is implemented on a bicycle robot, of which
   they are able to balance on rollers.
[Iuchi2006]_
   They use the same model base as [Iuchi2005]_ except they now add in a human
   torque estimator, so that the controller will not treat the human's applied
   steer torque as a disturbance if the controller is activated while a rider
   is also trying to control the bicycle. They show some crude experimental
   results, of which I assume are of a rider controlling the bicycle with and
   without the automatic controller activated. Their human torque accounting is
   based off of a estimation of the human torque from the steer motor torque,
   rather than explicitly measuring the human's torque input.
[Yamakita2006]_
   They implement a modified controller from the one presented in
   [Yamakita2005]_ with an additional :math:`H_\infty` controller. They show
   some successful roll stabilization of a robot scooter in which they only
   implement the roll stabilization control.
[Murata2011]_
   The Murata Manufacturing company designed a bicycle robot to demonstrate the
   utility of their sensors which debuted sometime in 2006 [Murata2011]_.
   There is little published detail on the control techniques but they seem to
   primarily make use of a roll rate gyro with steering and a gyro actuator.
   They also have other sensors such as ultrasonic sensors for obstacle
   detection. They demonstrate stability at zero speed, reverse and forward speeds,
   stopping for obstacles, and tracking a narrow s-curve in their video
   material. There are no public papers detailing the control system.
[Taura2007]_
   This is Japanese Master's thesis on acrobatic bike robot that may be able to
   do a wheely. I was not able to find this paper.
[Murayama2007]_
   They use the same vehicle and control model as in [Yamakita2006]_ and a new
   two degree of freedom "rider" pendulum. They demonstrate roll stability of
   the robot at both zero forward speed up to 2 m/s.
[Thanh2008]_
   Thanh designs a controller with :math:`H_2/H_\infty` techniques and applies it
   to a bicycle robot which uses a flywheel for stabilization. He compares it
   to a PD controller and a genetic algorithm and shows that it is more robust.
[Mutsaerts2010]_
   designed a Lego NXT bicycle robot with a simple proportional steer into the
   direction of roll rate controller and `demonstrates
   <http://youtu.be/VxiOy4QzD7I>`_ the bicycle roll stability in crude turns
   and straight ahead running.
[BicyRobo2011]_
   In 2011 the first `BicyRobo Thailand student competition
   <http://bicyrobo.ait.ac.th/>`_ occurred and many videos on the internet
   demonstrate the successful design of some teams. The full size bicycle
   robots have roll stability and even path following. One video demonstrates
   students riding the robot bicycle and simultaneously applying manual steer
   torques.
[Yamaguchi2011]_ 
   The videos `<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT3vfSQePcs>`_ and
   `<http://ai2001.ifdef.jp/>`_ demonstrate an impressive remote controlled
   mini robot bicycle that is similar in nature to the [Berriah1999]_ design
   with remote control. He uses a commercially available bipedal robot seated
   on a small bicycle. A gyro detects the systems roll rate and he uses a PID
   controller to applied the correct steering for roll stabilization. The
   remote control is employed to control the heading.

Other papers that I either could not find, translate, or find time to read
include [Beznos1998]_, [Sooraksa2000]_, [Sooraksa2000a]_, [Muraoka2002]_,
[Oda2002]_, [Muhich2004]_, [Micchini2006]_, [Suprapto2006]_, [Solveberg2007]_,
[Tanaka2009]_, [Brekke2010]_, [Cerone2010]_, [Keo2011]_.

The limited success of most of the various bicycle robots demonstrates that the
actual implementation of single track vehicle control is not trivial. Some of
the robots could demonstrate basic roll stability and some even capable of path
tracking ability but many didn't quite work either. The Murata Boy robot is
quite impressive in its abilities but it uses control outside of what humans
are capable of. The motorcycle robot by Kageyama is probably the most
successful demonstration of a full sized vehicle with control of only steering.
The vehicle dynamic models and control methodologies are varied, implying that
many techniques may be applicable.

Theoretic Control Models
-------------------------

It is far easier to develop theoretic control models than taking them as far as
implementation. There are many more successfully designed models on paper than
implemented. This section details some of the modeling efforts.

[Forouhar1992]_
   He studied the robust stabilization of the wobble mode in motorcycles.
[Getz1994]_, [Getz1995]_, [Getz1995a]_
   He uses a simple bicycle model that exhibits non-minimum phase behavior and
   are able to track roll angle and forward velocity using proportional and
   derivative control. One year later, Getz adds path tracking to his model.
[Kageyama1996]_
   He uses a neural network model to balance a two wheeled vehicle.
[Cloyd1996]_
   They use the same simple bicycle model and tracking variables as [Nagai1983]_,
   but controlled it with linear quadratic regulator.
[Yavin1997]_ and [Yavin1998]_
   They study path tracking of a simple bicycle model using some kind of generalized
   control structure, with a bicycle model similar to [Getz1995]_.
[Sharp2001a]_
   They stabilize the roll angle of a motorcycle with a PID controller which
   operates on the error in roll angle to provide a steer torque. The gains for
   the controller are chosen by trial and error. The gains are difficult to
   find for low speed high roll angle scenarios.
[Suryanarayanan2002]_
   They use a simple bicycle model to build a roll rate feedback controller for a
   high speed recumbent bicycle. They use proportional feedback of the roll
   rate to control the steer angle.
[Lee2002]_
   They develop a control model based on something akin to sliding mode control to
   stabilize the bicycle and track a path.
[Chidzonga2003]_
   Chidzonga uses the simple point mass bicycle model with a load sharing
   controller to demonstrate a track stand around zero forward speed. Although
   the balancing might have just been due to a miracle from Jesus.
[Yamakita2004]_
   They setup a linear trajectory tracking control model and non-linear
   stabilization control by controlling steer torque, rider lean torque, and
   rear wheel torque. They demonstrate the control in a simulation of a bicycle
   jump maneuver.
[Karnopp2004]_
   Karnopp uses a very simply bicycle model and basic proportional control to
   demonstrate the counter steering require to balance the bicycle. He also
   examines rear steered bicycles.
[Niki2005]_
   This follows the [Tanaka2004]_ and [Iuchi2005]_ work, but adds in velocity
   tracking.
[Huyge2005]_
   He makes use of the [Cossalter2002]_ motorcycle model with a eight body
   rider bio-mechanical model. He stabilizes the bodies and tracks a path using
   LQR control.
[Astrom2005]_
   They apply simple proportional control of a point mass type bicycle model to
   stabilize the roll angle with a steer angle input.
[Sharma2006]_
   They stabilize a simple bicycle model using fuzzy control rules to provide a
   desired roll correction based on the current steer and roll angles. The
   simulations show stability but with very erratic control that seem like it
   would be poor for a real controller.
[Limebeer2006]_
   They implement a PD controller on roll rate to stabilize the Whipple bicycle
   model outside the stable speed range.
[Findlay2006]_
   A simple point mass bicycle is stabilized by steer angle using three
   methods: a classical lead/lag compensator design, Ackerman pole placement
   and LQR optimal control.
[Sharp2007a]_
   He develops a path tracking controller for the benchmark bicycle
   [Meijaard2007]_ based on full state feedback and optimal control (LQR). He
   explores tight to loose control and shows how the gains vary with speed. He
   also include a preview model of which the tight control needs 2.5s of
   preview and the loose control needs at least 12.5 s. It is interesting to
   note that he found little change in computed gains for 20% variations in the
   various model parameters, leading him to conclude that the rider would be
   robust to various bicycle designs. His controllers show good performance for
   randomly generated paths.
[Sharp2007]_
   Here Sharp extends his LQR control method with preview from [Sharp2007a]_ to
   the motorcycle with the addition of rider lean torque control. He says that
   the objective was to develop a control scheme that *somewhat* represents a
   rider which is simple and effective. His controller inputs are the rider's
   upper-body absolute and relative lean angles and the path tracking error. He
   claims that riders control the motorcycle at the weave frequency at high
   speeds. He is able successfully stabilize and track a path and determines
   optimal preview gains. He also finds that the rider lean torque control is
   relatively ineffective and even with high weighting in the LQR formulation,
   the steer torque input dominates the optimal solution.
[Sharp2008a]_
   Sharp applies his LQR based preview model control model from [Sharp2007]_ to
   the benchmark bicycle. His findings are somewhat similar. His bicycle model
   is 6th order (he includes heading and path deviation) and he sets up the
   optimal control problem on full state feedback including varying numbers of
   path preview points. The bicycle tracks a path well and he shows high,
   medium, and low authority control by changing the LQR weightings. In general
   the bicycle roll angle and rate gains are the largest, with rider lean gains
   following, and steer related gains being the smallest. His leaning rider is
   initially stabilized by a passive spring and damper, and he finds that the
   lean torque control is minor when paired with steer torque control. Lean
   torque alone requires very high gains.
[Marumo2007]_
   Marumo and Nagai design both a PD controller with respect to roll angle and
   an LQR controller with full state feedback to stabilize the roll of Sharp's
   basic motorcycle model through steer torque. The intention is to have a
   steer-by-wire system so the rider can specify the desired roll angle with
   something like a joystick, thus alleviating the need for the human to learn
   to counter steer. They include an additional torque to the controller output
   computed from the steady state inverse steer torque to roll angle transfer
   function.
[Chidzonga2007]_
   Chidzonga expands on the work in [Chidzonga2007]_ by once again managing a
   track stand with a load sharing control scheme.
[Peterson2008a]_
   Peterson designs a yaw rate and rear wheel speed tracking controller based
   on full state feedback and LQR control. He uses a non-linear Whipple like
   model with rider lean torque as the only control input. His simulation
   required 30 Nm of rider lean torque for a 0.3 rad/sec and 1 rad/sec step in
   yaw rate and rear wheel rate respectively.
[Keo2008]_
   They stabilize a bicycle model with a leaning "rider" pendulum and track a
   path.
[Connors2009]_
   Connors adds moving legs to the Whipple bicycle model and uses parameters to
   simulate a low slung recumbent bicycle. He designs an LQR full state
   feedback controller to stabilize the bicycle.

The following papers were either not found, not translated, or I did not read
them, but they all have single track vehicle control: [Nakano1997]_,
[Chen2000]_, [Park2001]_, [Frezza2003]_, [Kamata2003]_, [Niki2005a]_,
[Saccon2006]_, [Bjermeland2006]_, [Chen2006]_.

Variations on PID control of steer angle or steer torque with feedback of the
roll angle are the most popular controller designs, many them being successful.
LQR type follow close behind. :math:`H_\infty` and other more modern control
designs make up the rest. It is clear that roll stabilization and command is
the critical task and must be conquered before path tracking can be employed.
The steer torque is generally chosen as the primary input with just cause and
rider leaning is also used in some models.

Basic Control
=============

It turns out that the Whipple bicycle model can be stabilized with simple
feedback of roll angle or roll rate, with the combination of both working in
most cases. [Mutsaerts2010]_ in fact demonstrates the simple roll rate feedback
stabilization with a small robotic bicycle. But these are not necessarily good
controllers, and certainly not controllers which mimic the human. Regardless,
their simplicity allows one to  demonstrate some of the interesting system
dynamics. Take for example Charlie riding on the Rigidcl bicycle at 7 m/s. The
linear Whipple model about the nominal configuration gives the steer torque and
roll torque inputs to roll and steer angle outputs transfer functions as

.. math::
   :label: eqExampleBicycleTransferFunctions

   \left(\frac{\phi}{T_\phi}\right)_b(s) =
   \frac{0.0095052 (s+26.32) (s+16.78)}
   {(s+22.28) (s+0.5872) (s^2 + 2.801s + 11.24)}

   \left(\frac{\delta}{T_\phi}\right)_b(s) =
   \frac{-0.094941 (s-3.744) (s+2.729)}
   {(s+22.28) (s+0.5872) (s^2 + 2.801s + 11.24)}

   \left(\frac{\phi}{T_\delta}\right)_b(s) =
   \frac{-0.094941 (s+107.8) (s+20.83)}
   {(s+22.28) (s+0.5872) (s^2 + 2.801s + 11.24)}

   \left(\frac{\delta}{T_\delta}\right)_b(s) =
   \frac{5.5445 (s+2.934) (s-2.934)}
   {(s+22.28) (s+0.5872) (s^2 + 2.801s + 11.24)}

The denominators of the transfer functions show that we have three stable
modes, as expected. The numerators are potentially more interesting. Note that
the steer torque to steer angle and the roll torque to steer angle transfer
functions both have a single right half plane zero. This single right half
plane zero means that the steer angle response from either input will exhibit
an initial undershoot for a given steer torque input [Hoagg2007]_. This
phenomena can be demonstrated by examining the step response of the two
transfer functions with right half plane zeros :ref:`Figure 2
<figStableStepResponse>`.

.. _figStableStepResponse:

.. figure:: figures/control/stable-step-response.*
   :width: 4in
   :align: center
   :target: _images/stable-step-response.png

   The upper graph shows the roll and steer angle time histories for a step
   response roll torque to the Whipple model linearized about the nominal
   configuration. The lower graph input is for a step input to steer torque.
   The parameters are taken from the rider Charlie on the Rigicl bicycle and
   the speed is 7 m/s which is within the stable speed range. Generated by
   ``src/control/control.m``.

As expected we see initial undershoot in the steer angle for both cases. In
this case, the initial undershoot is initially departs in the asymptotic
direction, but reverses and settles to a negative steer angle. This is easily
demonstrated on a real bicycle by placing one's flat open palms on the
handlebar grips. By applying a torque intending to turn the handlebars in the
positive direction, the handlebars initially go in the correct direction, but
once the frame rolls in the negative direction, the steering angle reverses and
puts the bicycle into a steady turn in the negative direction.

If we examine the change in the transfer function zeros as a function of
forward speed, we see that both the steer angle transfer functions always have
a right half plane zero. And for :math:`\frac{\delta}{T_\delta}(s)`, the zeros
do not change with respect to speed. It is also interesting to note that below
about 2 m/s the roll torque to roll angle transfer function has a right half plane
zero. For roll torque, this would mean that at low speeds a positive roll
torque step input (i.e from a gust of wind) would cause a positive roll angle
initial overshoot with the roll angle settling to a negative value at steady
state. I've often felt like I fall into the wind on my bicycle and this could
confirm it at least for low speeds, but it may be tied more to phenomena
associated with the rider's biomechanical degrees of freedom.

The numerators the transfer functions from the inputs to the outputs are
computed with

   \mathbf{C} \operatorname{adj}(s \mathbf{I}_4 - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{B} =
   \mathbf{0}_{4 \times 4}

Limiting the solution to  only the steer torque input and solving for the roots
of the polynomials, the zeros are found

.. math::
   :label: eqRoots

   s_{\phi} =
   -\frac{{c_1}_{\phi\delta} v}{2 m_{\phi\delta}}
   -\frac{\sqrt{{c_1}_{\phi\delta}^{2} v^{2}
   -4 g {k_0}_{\phi\delta} m_{\phi\delta}
   -4 {k_2}_{\phi\delta} m_{\phi\delta} v^{2}}}{2 m_{\phi\delta}}

   s_{\delta} = \pm\sqrt{-\frac{g {k_0}_{\phi\phi}}{m_{\phi\phi}}}

The zeros of :math:`\left( \frac{\delta}{T_\delta} \right)_b(s)` are simply a
function of the total potential energy of the system divided by the roll moment
of inertia with respect to the center of mass.

.. math::

   s_{\delta} = \pm\sqrt{-\frac{g m_T z_T}{{I_T}_{xx}}}

This right half plane zero is important for understanding how to control a
bicycle. Controlling by steer torque leads to unintuitive behavior of the
bicycle, which must be learned.

Notice too that the roll torque transfer function zeros are both functions of
speed. The steer angle zero varies little and has a right half plane zero for
all speeds of interest. But more interestingly, one roll angle zero is positive
below about 2 m/s and negative above. This means that for very slow speeds, we
will see an initial undershoot response in roll angle but not at higher speeds.

Counter Steering
----------------

Countersteering is the colloquial term used to describe this non-minimum phase
behavior demonstrated in the previous section. Motorcycle driving instructors
are keenly aware of this and teach their students to steer into the obstacle
that they want to go around.

[Limebeer2006]_ and [Sharp2008a]_ duly note that the term countersteering is
used for potentially two conflicting ideas. They examine the effects of the
right half plane zero of a simplified point mass model in much the same way as
[Astrom2005]_. Sharp and Limebeer show that both the steer torque to steer
angle and steer torque to lateral deviation have right half plane zeros and
Åström develops a *steer angle* to roll angle transfer function that has a
right half plane zero. The Whipple model matches the [Limebeer2006]_
interpretation, i.e. that the right half plane zero is the steer torque to
steer angle transfer function.

The first and most common definition of countersteer is

   To initiate a turn, steer torque is applied in the opposite direction you
   want to turn which in turn causes the steer angle to initially depart in the
   opposite direction of the turn, but after the vehicle rolls the steer angle
   reverses into the direction of the turn.

The second definition, also clarified by [Cossalter2007]_, regards the sign of
the steer torque in steady turns

   The applied steer torque may reverse sign to maintain steady turn. This is
   generally true at high speeds.

The step response to steer torque at a stable speed shows that for a given roll
angle departure the natural stability enforces that steer angle must initially
depart in the opposite direction, :ref:`Figure 2 <figStableStepResponse>`. In
the case of roll torque input, a positive roll torque causes a positive roll
angle but an initially negative steer angle. Afterwards the bicycle settles
into a positive steady turn with respect to yaw. For the steer torque input, a
positive steer torque causes an initially positive steer angle which in turn
cause a negative roll angle. The bicycle settles into a negative steady turn.

To see this phenomena outside of the stable speed range some form of control is
needed to stable simulations. Below the weave critical speed, the bicycle can
generally be stabilized by a simple gain on roll rate feedback. Note that this
gain is negative, giving positive feedback. This implies that we apply steer torque
in the same sense as the rate of fall [#negativegain]_. :ref:`Figure 4
<figWeaveeStepResponse>` shows the response to a commanded steer torque below
the weave speed and the countersteering in the steer angle.

.. _figWeaveStepResponse:

   The step response to a commanded steer torque at 5.0 m/s which is below the
   weave speed. The gain is set to -5. Generated by ``src/control/control.m``.

And above the capsize critical speed, the bicycle can be stabilized by a simple
gain on roll angle feedback which is also negative. :ref:`Figure 5
<figCapsizeResponse>` shows the countering steering require above the stable
speed range.

.. _figCapsizeResponse:

.. figure:: figures/control/commanded-roll-angle.*

   The step response to a commanded roll angle at 10 m/s which is above the
   capsize speed. The gain is set to -10.1. Generated by
   ``src/control/control.m``.

For steer torque control inputs countersteering amounts to this: to get the
bicycle into a positive turn, one must initially apply a negative steer
torque to cause an initially negative steer angle and a positive roll angle.
The steer angle exhibits initial undershoot due to the right half plane zero
and settles to a positive angle at steady state. This is the case for at least
all speeds above very slow speeds where the steer torque to roll angle transfer
function has a right half plane zero.

Human Operator Control
======================

There are very few studies focusing explicitly on human control of a bicycle
or motorcycle with the intent of identifying the human controller or
controlling the vehicle with a human-like controller. The majority of the
studies of this nature happened in the early seventies when manual control
theories were relatively new. The following details the efforts that I've
come across in my research.

van Lunteren and Stassen
------------------------

van Lunteren and Stassen did some the earliest work on the subject. They were
primarily interested in identifying the human control system in the bicycle
riding task. Their studies spanned several years in the late 60's and early
70's. [Lunteren1967]_, [Lunteren1969]_, [Lunteren1970]_, [Lunteren1970a]_,
[Stassen1973]_, [Lunteren1973]_ uses a bicycle roll angle feedback with PID
control that drives the rider's lean angle and steer angle. The bicycle model
they employ is quite simple (it models their simulator more than a real
bicycle) and does not exhibit proper coupling in steer and roll. The model also
utilizes angle inputs as opposed to input torques.  Their control structure was
chosen in part because of equipment limitations and cite recent manual control
models [McRuer1967]_ as being preferable. Nonetheless the research was ground
breaking at the time and quite impressive, with real time system identification
in manually controlled electromechanical system. They concluded that roll angle
control was more reflexive and that the steer angle control was more cerebral
based on identified time delays. They further developed their system to include
a visual tracking outer loop. [Lange2011]_ develops a more up-to-date model
with the same type of structure as van Lunteren and Stassen, where he feeds
back roll angle and steer angle, and drives steer torque with PID controllers.
He also points out a sign error in van Lunteren and Stassen's work. 

Calspan
-------

The Calspan group developed a controller for their bicycle and motorcycle
research that parallels the Delft work except they make use of the latest
bicycle and motorcycle models with steer torque and learn torques as plant
inputs [Roland1972]_. The specifically point the advantages of describing the
inputs as torques and cite the Delft group's misguided assumptions. They design
a PID controller with time delays for both steer torque and rider lean torque
control to stabilize the inner roll loop. The outer loops consist of the
previewed error in the desired path in several future time steps. This error is
weighted to calculate a cumulative error which is then multiplied by a gain to
compute an adjustment to the commanded roll angle. They show simulations of
both good roll stabilization and slalom path tracking which they compare to
video footage of an actual bicycle rider.

Weir and Zellner
----------------

Weir worked with McRuer on some manual control papers prior to his PhD thesis
[Weir1972]_, where he employed the crossover model along side a motorcycle model
which is based on Sharp's early motorcycle model [Sharp1971]_ to evaluate the
controller used by humans. This is the most likely the first complete attempt
at analyzing the rider-motorcycle control system. Weir determined that roll
angle feedback combined with a basic human model and a simple gain controlling
steer torque was the most effective control mechanism. In particular, he showed
how steer angle control was poor and he even examined rider lean angle control
using a pseudo rider lean model similar to [Hess2012]_. Rider lean could
successfully control the system, but required large lean angles. He also worked
with multiple loop closures and found that roll angle fed back to control steer
torque with heading and lateral deviation fed back to control rider lean angle
presented the best control strategy for the human rider. He only did his
studies at a single high speed with a motorcycle model which only required
stabilization of the capsize mode. It is highly likely that these control
strategies could vary with speed, especially at low speed where the weave mode
is the dominant instability. Weir and Zellner went on to complete several more
important studies involving manual control of the motorcycle [Weir1978]_,
[Weir1979]_, including a detailed technical report for the U.S. Department of
Transportation [Weir1979a]_ in which much experimental work was done verifying
their mathematical models.

Eaton
-----

Eaton's PhD work builds off of Weir's work and is primarily focused on
validating the Weir models with experiments. He pairs the successful motorcycle
model develop by Sharp [Sharp1971]_ with Weir's McRuer style manual control
models that were based around the crossover model with time delays. He focus on
the inner loop roll stabilization tasks. His model feedbacks roll angle and the
controller compensates for roll angle error. He eliminates body lean control as
an option to simplify things.

Aoki
----

For completeness, [Aoki1979]_ should be included, although I have had time to
study his work. It looks promising with both a human control model and
experimental validation.

Doyle
-----

A recently uncovered study by Doyle ([Doyle1987]_, [Doyle1988]_), thanks to
Google's book scanning endeavors and Jim Papadopoulos's persistence in
searching, presents a slow speed view for bicycle control in much contrast to
the Weir studies, not only because of the speed and vehicle differences, but
because it is from the view of a psychologist. We engineers are quick to model
the human sensory and actuation system, with little understanding of the
intricacies of the human brain. Doyle's treatise gives a refreshing look from
outside the engineering box. Doyle's control model is fundamentally a
sequential loop closure with the inner most loop being roll control and the
outer two being heading and path deviation. He says that the outer loops are
highly dependent on the inner loop. For the inner loop he determines that
continuously feeding back both roll acceleration with integral and proportional
gains adjusted by the human as the crossover model dictates will stabilize the
bicycle at non-intended roll angles. To control roll angle, he claims that we
do not do this in a continuous but that we apply discrete pulses when the roll
angle meets a threshold. This continuous portion of this model has similar form
to the one developed by Weir and which in turn resembles our model which is
detailed in the next section.

Wu and Liu
----------

I'll mention briefly some about modeling the human with fuzzy control. I have
little understanding of fuzzy control but [Cloud1994]_ says that fuzzy control
methodologies fundamentally let one translate linguistic rules from an expert
in controlling the particular system into a control logic algorithm.
[Tagaki1983]_ discussed developing fuzzy control rules from the human
operator's actions. This somewhat parallels how the PID controller was
developed based on a ship helmsman's decision structure
[WikipediaPIDController2012]_. It seems like it may certainly be valuable for
conscious control efforts, but may have deficiencies when trying to determine
the control strategy of unconscious control. But a combination of fuzzy logic
and crossover type control may prove useful in describing the human control
system. Liu and Wu have done extensive work applying fuzzy control to single
track vehicles ([Liu1994]_, [Wu1994]_, [Wu1995]_, [Wu1996]_, [Wu1996a]_,
[Wu1996b]_, [Wu1996c]_). I have not studied the work in detail, but it is worth
noting here.

Mammar
------

[Mammar2005]_ developed a motorcycle control scheme based on a motorcycle
dynamics model similar to Robin Sharp's work with steer torque and rider lean
angle as the model inputs. He includes human model with four elements: a simple
second order neuromuscular model similar to [Hess2012]_, a time delay, gain,
and a first order lead filter representing a mental workload model. His control
elements include a roll angle feedback gain, a reference signal prefilter, and
a compensator with proportional, integral, and lead control terms. The
proportional term in the compensator is the only speed dependent term. They
select the numerical values for the control elements using :math:`H_\infty`
loop shaping for robustness. They finally show simulation results with good
performance with regards to disturbance rejection and roll tracking.

de Lange
--------

More recently, [Lange2011]_ wrote his master's thesis on identifying the human
controller in the bicycle-rider system. He employed a controller which fed back
roll angle and steer angle with PID plus second derivative control and time
delays to command steer torque through a neuromuscular model filter to the
Whipple model. The model is similar in flavor to van Lunteren and Stassen's,
but more up-to-date and uses more feedback loops. He chose eight gains plus
time delays and attempted to identify which loops were not important from the
experimental data presented in the next Chapter :ref:`systemidentification`. He
finds that the critical feedback variables for a stable model were roll angle,
roll rate, steering rate, and the integral of the steer angle, claiming the
last one in is proportional to heading and thus the rider controls heading with
steer. He also finds the time delays to generally destabilize his model and
removes them.

Hess
----

Finally, we've developed a control model with Ron Hess [Hess2012]_ that is used
later this dissertation for human operator identification. The following
section gives a brief synopsis, but one should refer to the published paper for
more detail.

Conclusion
----------

A single track vehicle can be stabilized and controlled by a variety of means.
Controllers based on simplified dynamical models can potentially control more
advanced linear and nonlinear models and/or real systems (i.e. steer into the
fall). The roll stabilization is the critical tasks, as path following can't
occur without roll control authority. Few people have demonstrated robust
control of a *real* system which stabilizes in roll at a variety of speeds. Even
fewer have added path tracking abilities. It doesn't seem like anyone has
stabilized a robotic bicycle with a controller that has the limitations of a
human built in.

Hess Manual Control Model
=========================

Many control model architectures can be used to attempt to identify the human
control system while riding the bicycle. We are limited by the type of sensory
information a human rider can sense, the human's processing delays, and the
bandwidth and physical limitations of the human's actuators. The human operator
has been modeled with simple models like the crossover model, to more complex
neuromuscular dynamics, and even fuzzy and optimal control; [Hess1997]_
provides a good overview. Some of the controllers are essentially equivalent
placing the closed loop poles in the same place, but make use of different
techniques to get to the end result. [Lange2011]_ notes that all feedback
controllers can be mapped to a common structure. The models may also be
different in complexity. But in general finding the simplest mathematical model
capable of capturing the dynamics one is interested in is a good goal. With
this in mind, my advisor Ron Hess developed a controller based on the Whipple
bicycle model and his previous successful multi-loop human operator models. We
present the control model and the loop closure procedure for selecting the five
model gains in [Hess2012]_. This model is fundamentally similar in nature to
Weir's work and is built on the same foundations such as that of McRuer et. al.
We similarly found steer angle based control to be troublesome and had success
across a broad range of speeds and selection of bicycles with steer torque
control. We also employed a similar method of evaluating rider lean control
without introducing an extra degree of freedom. It also has semblance to the work
of [Doyle1987]_ with the inner loop structure dedicated to roll stabilization
and the outer loops to high cognitive control in heading and path tracking.


Basics of manual control theory
-------------------------------

Manual control, or human operator control, was primarily birthed from control
engineers after World War II. The requirements for machine designs in which
humans were the principal control element, such as artillery guns and aircraft,
led to human control modeling. Theoretical work by [Tustin1947]_ theorized
early on that a human control systems could be modeled similarly to automatic
feedback systems. Tustin's work was followed by years of theoretical and
experimental work by McRuer and group to understand the control system of
aircraft pilots.

McRuer's found out that it turns out that humans adjust their control such that
the combined human and plant dynamics behave with desirable closed loop
dynamics in many types of tracking tasks. This phenomena can be captured by a
variety of theoretical control structures from simple dynamics to complex
neuromuscular models [Hess1997]_. Fortunately, the simpler models can often
capture much of the essential dynamics in human-machine systems such our
bicycle-rider system. In particular, we make use of the crossover model
[McRuer1974]_ to structure our controller design. The reason for this is
multi-fold. It allows us to stick with a simple system which has been applied
to numerous man-machine systems with good results.

The basic idea of the crossover model is that the when the human is paired
with the plant which she is trying to control that the combined open loop
transfer function conforms to the dictates of a sound control system design
around the crossover frequency [Hess1997]_. The form of this transfer function
for many control tasks remarkably takes the form

.. math::
   :label: crossover

   G_{human}G_{plant}(s) = \frac{\omega_c e^{-\tau_e s}}{s}

The model is governed by only two parameters: the cross over frequency,
:math:`\omega_c` and the effective time delay, :math:`\tau_e`. The simplicity
of this model and its ability to describe many human in the loop systems is
what makes it so powerful.

The model is capable of describing the dynamics of the human at various
crossover frequencies and various performance levels. The majority of the
model's experimental validation efforts have been based around laboratory and
vehicle control tasks where good performance was required (i.e. skilled
subjects).

We also focus only on compensatory control structure where the human closes
loops based on output error. This is a simplification as human's are able to
to take advantage of pursuit and preview based control.

.. todo:: Cerebellum is the lower brain (learned control). High cortical
   regions and outer cortex is the higher brain. Under-conscious control or sub
   conscious.

Model Description
-----------------

The control structure was designed to meet these requirements:

1. Roll stabilization is the primary task, with path following in the outer
   loops. The system should be stable in roll before closing the path following loops.
2. The input to the bicycle and rider biomechanic model is steer torque.
3. The neuromuscular mode of the closed system should have a natural frequency
   around 10 rad/s to match laboratory tracking tasks of a human operator.
4. The system should be simple. In our case such that only simple gains are
   needed to stabilized the system and close all the loops.
5. We should see evidence of the crossover model in the open roll, heading, and
   lateral deviation loops.

The multi-loop model we use is constructed with a sequential loop closure
technique that sets the model up to follow the dictates of the crossover model.
The three inner loops manage the roll stabilization task and the outer two
loops manage the path following. We include a simple second order model of the
human's neuromuscular dynamics which produces a steer torque from the steer
angle error.

.. math::
   :label: eqNeuromuscular

   G_{nm}(s) = \frac{\omega_{nm}^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta_{nm}\omega_{nm}s + \omega_{nm}}

The neuromuscular parameters, :math:`\zeta_{nm}` and :math:`\omega_{nm}`, were
chosen as 0.707 and 30 rad/s, respectively, such that the innermost loops gave
a typical response for a human operator.

The bicycle is modeled using the Whipple model linearized about the nominal
configuration with the primary control input being steer torque. The inner
loops are closed with sequential gains starting with the proprioceptive steer
angle loop, followed by the vestibular roll rate loop, and the visual roll
angle loop [#blind]_, :ref:`Figure 6 <figInnerLoops>`. The steer angle loop in
essence captures the force/feel or haptic feedback we use while interacting
with the handlebars. The need for this loop is readily apparent when trying to
control a bicycle simulation with a joystick or steering wheel with no haptic
feedback as demonstrated in [Lange2011]_; the difficultly level is high without
it. We found that this proprioceptive loop was essential for stabilization and
closed loop performance, unlike typical aircraft control models. The outer
loops are also visual: heading and lateral path deviation, :ref:`Figure 7
<figOuterLoops>`.

.. _figInnerLoops:

   :width: 5in

   :target: _images/inner-loops.png

   The inner loop structure of the control system.

.. _figOuterLoops:

.. figure:: figures/control/outer-loops.*
   :width: 4in
   :align: center
   :target: _images/outer-loops.png

   The outer loop structure of the control system with the inner loops closed.

The control structure is simply a function of five gains, which the human
"choose" such that the dictates of the crossover model are met to get good
overall system performance. The two inner most loop gains are chosen such that
all of the oscillatory roots of the closed roll rate loop have at least a 0.15
damping ratio. Whereas the three outer loop gains are chosen such that the
system has a 20db slope around crossover. The crossover frequencies are
selected sequentially such that the next is half the value of the previous.

Traditionally, sequential loop closure methods are performed on a case by case
basis and involve some subjectiveness in applying the design rules of thumb.
This is time consuming and error prone when you have to find the gains for many
systems such as our bicycles and riders at various speeds. The technique
described in [Hess2012]_ can be automated to alleviate this. The following
gives the details for developing the gain selection routine.

The closed roll angle loop should be stable, as stability in roll is critical
for the path tracking in the outer two loops. To get there, the closure of the
proprioceptive and vestibular loops must push the poles to a favorable spot for
application of the crossover model on the roll angle loop. To do this, the
first two loop closure require that all of the oscillatory modes have a minimum
damping ratio of 0.15 and natural frequency out around 10 rad/s. We first use
the proprioceptive gain, :math:`k_\delta` to push the poles originating at the
bicycle weave eigenvalue to a higher frequency with about 0.55 damping ratio.
The choice of this gain is somewhat ambiguous, but it needs to set the weave
mode pole such that it has a small enough damping ratio to allow the roll rate
loop to further push it to a damping ratio of 0.15. In [Hess2012]_ we make both
loops have a 0.15 damping ratio, but that is not necessary and make not be what
the human chooses. The closed loop transfer function for the steer loop is

.. math::
   :label: eqDeltaLoop

   G_{\delta c}(s) = \frac{\delta}{\delta_c}(s) =
   \frac{G_{\delta o}(s)}{1 + G_{\delta o}(s)}

   G_{\delta o}(s) = k_\delta G_{nm} \left(\frac{\delta}{T_\delta}\right)_b(s)

A numerical example of Charlie on the Rigidcl bicycle at 5 m/s give numerical
values for the open steer angle loop

.. math::
   :label: eqDeltaLoopNumerical

   G_{\delta o}(s)|_{k_\delta = 1} =
   \frac{4990.0342 (s+2.934) (s-2.934)}
   {(s+17.08) (s+2.56) (s^2 - 1.306s + 5.18) (s^2 + 43.02s + 900)}

The characteristic equation is 6th order and the caster, capsize, and
neuromuscular modes are all stable whereas the weave model is unstable. The
first loop closure will drive the unstable weave pole out to a higher frequency
and mid-range damping ratio.

To set the damping ratio multiple approaches can be taken, here I'll show a
Bode design approach and a root locus based design. For the Bode design we
select a gain that creates a damped neuromuscular peak out around 10 rad/s,
:ref:`Figure 8 <figDeltaBode>`. For this bicycle and speed, a gain of ~17.5
will set the inner loop as desired.

.. _figDeltaBode:

.. figure:: figures/control/delta-bode.*
   :width: 4in
   :align: center
   :target: _images/delta-bode.png

   The Bode plots of the closed steer loop with various gains. Notice how the
   higher gains start to push the neuromuscular peak closer to a frequency
   typical of human operator and plant dynamics [Hess2012]_.

By plotting the root locus of the closed loop poles as a function of
:math:`k_\delta` the desired gain can also easily be picked off on a root locus
diagram, :ref:`Figure 9 <figDeltaLocus>`.  The root locus of the closed delta
loop poles as a function of :math:`k_\delta` gives an idea where we can push
the poles for the next loop closure. Notice that the poles associated with the
weave mode at :math:`k_\delta=0` are pushed into the stable regime and back
out, crossing the 0.55 damping ratio line twice. There is a range of gains
between about 4.0 and 17.5 which cause all of the oscillatory modes to have at
least 0.55 damping ratio. This is very clear when plotting the damping ratio
versus gain in :ref:`Figure 10 <figDeltaDamp>`. The best choice is typically to
set the gain such that the pole is at the highest frequency allowable with
minimum damping, to give typical human operator behavior. This will set up the
bandwith of the sub sequent loops to be high enough for good system
performance.

   gains such that all the roots are stable and the damping ratio is at least
   0.55, although inner loop stability is not a requirement for total system
   stability.

With the loop closed at :math:`k_\delta=17.48` the transfer function takes the form

.. math::
   :label: eqDeltaClosed

   G_{\delta c}(s) =
   \frac{87225.7974 (s+2.934) (s-2.934)}
   {(s+3.175) (s-1.767) (s^2 + 10.86s + 97.55) (s^2 + 48.48s + 998.8)}

Notice the single unstable poll at :math:`s=1.767`. The roll rate loop closure
transfer function takes the form

.. math::
   :label: eqPhiDotLoop

   G_{\dot{\phi} c}(s) =
   \frac{\dot{\phi}}{\dot{\phi}_c}(s) =
   \frac{G_{\dot{\phi} o}(s)}{1 + G_{\dot{\phi} o}(s)}

   G_{\dot{\phi} o}(s) =
   k_{\dot{\phi}}
   k_{\delta}
   G_{nm}(s)
   \left( \frac{\dot{\phi}}{T_\delta} \right)_b(s)
   [1 - G_{\delta c}(s)]

The roll rate loop gain is now chosen such that the neuromuscular mode has a
minimum damping ratio of 0.15 and is around 10 rad/s. From :ref:`Figure 11
<figPhiDotDamp>` we see that we need to set the roll rate gain to a negative
values, about -0.44. Since the bicycle with steer control exhibits non-minimum
behavior, we need to introduce a positive feedback on roll rate. So it turns
out that with a small negative gain we can maintain the neuromuscular mode
behavior but introduce the required sign change for stability. This gives the
desired 10 db peaking in the bode diagram, :ref:`Figure 12 <figPhiDotBode>`.

   {(s+8.106) (s-0.6015) (s^2 + 3.121s + 107.6) (s^2 + 50.13s + 1042)}

The bicycle-rider system is similar enough in nature for speeds above 2 m/s
that this loop closure seems to always work. We've had some trouble stabilizing
the model at speeds below 2 m/s with the choice of :math:`k_\delta` an
important factor in the ability to stabilize at low speeds. [Lange2011]_
reported difficulties stabilizing his system below about 2 m/s too. We've found
that relaxing the 10 db peak requirement on the inner most loop such that the
neuromuscular mode is more damped, will allow for successive closure and a
stable system for lower speeds. But as we all know, the bicycle is very
difficult for a human to balance at extremely low speeds. The fast time
constants compounded with human neuro processing delays makes this true. There
are such things as slow bicycle competitions that take advantage of this fact
to test the balancing skill of the rider.

With the roll rate loop closed, the final three loops can be closed by setting
the gain such that the crossover frequency of the roll most loop is 2 rad/s
and the outer loops crossover at half the previous frequency. This is easily
set by measuring the gain of transfer function at the desired crossover
frequency and realizing that a unit change in gain will raise or lower the gain
curve.

As can be surmised from the Bode diagram, :ref:`Figure 12 <figPhiBode>` we've
now stabilized the system in roll by forcing the system to behave like the

   the counter steering and the steady state error in the roll angle.

   G_{\phi c}(s) =
   \frac{1639.4234 (s+77.09) (s+14.79)}
   {(s+6.881) (s+1.982) (s^2 + 1.864s + 93.21) (s^2 + 50.03s + 1041)}

It is important to note that this system is a Type 0 system and exhibits steady
error as seen in :ref:`Figure 13 <figRollStable>`. If we were only concerned
with roll stabilization a low frequency integrator would be needed to remove
the steady state error. This was not included in the model design, because the
integrator is not needed if the heading loop is closed around the system. The
remaining loops are closed using the rule of thumb [Hess1997]_ of crossing over
at half the previous loop's crossover frequency.

   The open loop frequency response for the front wheel lateral deviation loop.
   Blue is gain of unity and the green line is uses the gain to give desired
   crossover.

At this point all the loops are closed and the bicycle can track a given path
with good performance. The closed loop system bandwith is approximately equal
to the open loop crossover frequency of the lateral deviation loop.
:ref:`Figure 14 <figTrackPath>` shows the system response to a step commanded
input to lateral deviation.

   The step response to a commanded lateral path deviation. Notice that for the
   positive rightward turn, the steer torque and steer angle are negative to
   initiate the positive turn.

The gains can be computed across a relevant speed range for the bicycle.
:ref:`Figure 15 <figGains>` shows how the gains vary with respect to speed for
a particular bicycle and rider. Notice that at higher speeds the gains change
somewhat linearly, but at speeds below 3 m/s there is non-linear variation.
These gains give a stable system which is capable of the lane change manuever,
but due to the difficulties in selecting the gains with rules above the
algorthm may be making poor choices, especially for :math:`k_{\dot{\phi}}`.

   The auto computed gains as a function of speed for the Davis instrumented
   biycle with Jason as the rider. These gains were computed with the method in
   [Hess2012]_. Generated by ``src/davisbicycle/plot_gains.py``.

We automated this method based on the Bode design guidelines. The gain choices
for proper neuromuscular peaks in the inner most loops require good initial
guesses, as there is often multiple solutions. The correct solution puts the
neuromusclar natural frequency at a typical value for human operators.

Software
--------

I designed a software suite in Matlab to implement the automated gain selected
for various bicycles, riders, and speeds. The software was constructed around a
simulink model of the model describe above and offers this functionality:

#. It generates the state space form of the linear Whipple model for any
   parameter sets and speeds. The outputs include all eight of the configuration
   variables and their derivatives reported in Chapter :ref:`eom` with the
   addition of the front contact point. This includes the lateral force input
   described in Chapter :ref:`extensions`.

#. It generates the state space form of the closed loops system as a function
   of the bicycle-rider parameters, the speed, the five gains and the
   neuromuscular frequency.

#. It computes the gains with the sequential loop closure guidelines described
   above for any give bicycle-rider and speed. (Very low speeds may require some
   manual tweaking.) The open and closed loop transfer functions for each loop
   can be returned and or plotted. It can also do this for roll torque as the
   input as described in [Hess2012]_.

#. It simulates the system performing a single or double lane change with a
   given or computed set of gains and plots the results.

#. It computes the lateral force input transfer functions.

#. It computes the handling quality metric described in [Hess2012]_.

#. It plots the gains versus speed.

The software was used to generate most of the results and plots in [Hess2012]_
and the source code for doing so is included. The source can be downloaded at
`<https://github.com/moorepants/HumanControl>`_.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#negativegain] The system can be stabilized by negative roll angle feedback at speeds
   close to the weave critical speed.

.. [#blind] [Doyle1988]_ notes that his riders can balance even while blindfolded.
   This is even true for people who've been blind since birth. So the roll
   angle dectection, must not necessarily be all visual based.
