The roots of my interest in bicycle dynamics come from an earlier time but
didn't take hold until I attempted to model the bicycle in Mont Hubbard's
multi-body dynamics class. My first inquires about bicycle dynamics came from
my attempts to design a recumbent bicycle frame for my senior design project at
Old Dominion University. Recumbents are notorious for not handling well and we
were building one for the annual ASME Human Powered Vehicle challenge and it
needed to be suitable for novice riders to control. I found myself in the
design process where one needs to choose the wheel sizes, front end geometry
and location and seating position of the rider. As an engineer is taught to, I
went looking for technical guidelines to choose these parameters for out
bicycle design, but all I came back with were many conflict testaments from
various bicycle fabricators and Bicycling Science 2nd Ed which gave a synopisis
of Jones', [Jones1970]_, conclusions from famous study on the stability of
bicycles. I studied this in detail and designed my bicycle geometry to be
exactly what was specified as good handling by Jones.[#tubes]_ The bicycle was
rideable (after lots of practice), but this was probably the first time I
realized as a young engineer that there wasn't a formula for everything.

This dissertation will hopefully document the majority of work I've done at UC
Davis and TU Delft since Fall 2005 with respect my dissertation topic.

Reproducibility

   Talk about the attempt for the majority of the work in the disseratation to
   be reproducible.

.. [#tubes] It wasn't till after welding the bicycle frame together did I
            realize that I'd cut a tube too long and the geometry was very
            different than I'd planned.
