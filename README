Sphinx Build Details
====================

This document was built with Sphinx 1.1.3. It makes use of three extensions two
of which are part of Sphinx (sphinx.ext.todo, sphinx.ext.mathjax) and one which
is a custom extension for incorporating bibliographic data from a bibtex
database (sphinxcontrib.bibtex).

The figures and tables are all stored in the ``figures`` and ``tables``
directory and most are autogenerated with the source code in the ``src``
directory and data stored in teh ``data`` directory.
