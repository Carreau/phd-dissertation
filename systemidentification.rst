Preface
=======

I started to think about system identification when I arrived at Delft and the
discussions began with Arend and Jodi. I hadn't much clue about the formal
field and theory of system identification. My first look at it was when Arend
presented me with a light introduction by Ljung, so I credit Arend and his
cohorts for the ideas that have been implemented in this chapter. We talked
about it here and there but never really put together a solid experimental plan
to do anything about it. Karl Åström visited us in Delft in late 2008 and we
talked some with him about system identification of the bicycle. I mainly recall
him focusing on how to excite the system in a very controlled manner with an
oscillating mass on the bicycle. Some of these ideas propagated through Arend
to Peter and can be seen in the final sections of his thesis [Lange2011]_. Many
of these ideas influenced our NSF proposal and ultimately the final portion of
what I was to do for my dissertation work.

Once I had gotten back to Davis we now had the resources available from NSF
funding to make something happen. My goal had basically formalized into
creating a instrumented bicycle to be controlled by person that was capable of
measuring all of the kinematics and kinetics involved seen in regulated control
tasks. We also originally had hoped to be able to vary the dynamics of the
bicycle, but the reduced funding nixed that idea. It took some time into the
project to really understand what we may be able to accomplish with that but it
finally materialized into validating Ron's theoretic control model which is
discussed in [Hess2012]_ and Chapter :ref:`control` with data collected via the
instrumented bicycle. After our first experiments, over a year into the project
timeline it became apparent that simple tasks with measured lateral
perturbations would provide the best chance of us validating his model.
Unfortunately, I had not thought a great deal about how to provide and measure
these lateral perturbations but the manually excited perturbations seemed to to
trick.

We ran a lot of preliminary system identification analyses on the first set of
trial data, but it quickly became apparent that we had little understanding in
the subject. The early analyses did give confidence that data was of good
enough quality to do something with, but our goal of identifying the parameters
of the controller were still far from our reach.

We performed the final set of experiments around August and September of 2011
to get a large sample of data for the final analyses. The NSF grant was to end
at the end of September and I still had to figure out how to analyze all of
the data, not to mention write up a ton of work for my dissertation. We ended
up extending the NSF grant another year (as seems to be typical with these
things). I look back to our original proposal and in hindsight the scope was
way too large (accurately predicted by Arend). We nixed the handling qualities
parts when the funding was lowered, but I now see that what we hope to do
really took another 6-12 months than we had intended.

The final analyses has forced me to figure out what system identification is
all about and I've learned a great deal rapidly and much on my own. At this
stage we weren't able to find any local experts on the subject to help us along
but I've gotten some great insight from both the single track vehicle dynamics
email list and in from personal communication with Karl Åström. I still feel
very weak in the subject but it is more clear how difficult identifying complex
systems is, especially trying to nail down physical parameters.

As many doctoral students probably hope when starting their long trek to the
PhD, I hoped for some grand findings to arise from this work. But I've been
humbled a lot in that quest. I present here the work I've done with regards to
identifying the bicycle and rider system with what I think are good results,
but I hope that it is more of guide for others to see some of the difficulties
in executing this kind of analyses with some ideas to better structure it.

Introduction
============

The work presented in this Chapter is intended to be the icing on the cake that
takes into account all of the theory presented in the previous chapters and
evaluates it with a large set of data taken with the instrumented bicycle
described in Chapter :ref:`davisbicycle`. It is also the overarching
deliverable I was responsible for under the NSF grant. This chapter details
system identification of a bicycle and rider system. It is broken in two main
parts, the first's goal being to identify the passive bicycle rider system and
the second to identify the active portion, i.e. the rider's control system. The
literature review gives an introduction to other's efforts in both these
analyses with respect to single track vehicles.

Literature
==========

There is a rich history of bicycle and motorcycle mathematical model
development. This has been able to explain many of the more dynamically
fascinating phenomena from countersteering and stability to speedman’s wobble
and gyroscopic effects. But the amount of experimental validation of these
idealized models pales in comparison, with the motorcycle experimentation
outdistancing that done with bicycles.

Basic bicycle and motorcycle identification is typically done on data collected
by exciting the vehicle through either force/torque perturbations in roll or
steer. These experiments can be done when the bicycle is under closed loop
control or when the bicycle is stable, the former being a requirement for
speeds outside of the stable speed range. But, the mode excitation methods are
limited to the frequency band around that mode of motion. Manual excitation
under closed loop control gives better excitation bandwidth and a pairing with
modern system identification techniques can provide richer models.

Passive Vehicle and Rider Identification
----------------------------------------

Identification of the passive vehicle rider models are more numerous than the
controller identification. It is indeed a requirement to have a very good
vehicle model before attempting to identify the control system a human employs
while controlling the system. The bicycle and motorcycle are excellent choices
for manual control experiment design due to the fact that they are relatively
economical systems that require a broad range of human control skills to
stabilize and direct the vehicle, but they have the disadvantage that the first
principles models may not be very robust predictors of the motion due as a
simpler or more well studied system. The approaches to identifying the passive
model include mode excitation techniques to system identification under more
general inputs.

CALSPAN
~~~~~~~

The earliest comprehensive bicycle model validation began at CALSPAN in the
late 60’s. This included several revolutionary studies, in one of which they
made use of a rocket to apply know step torques to an uncontrolled riderless
bicycle. In another, simulations of slalom maneuvers were visually compared
with video footage [Roland1971]_.

Eaton
~~~~~

David Eaton's work ([Eaton1973]_, [Eaton1973a]_, [Eaton1973b]_) may be the
closest example to the work presented in this chapter. He did his PhD work at
the University of Michigan under the Highway Safety Research Institute. His
dissertation focused on the experimental validation of the motorcycle modeling
work of [Sharp1971]_ and the human controller modeling work of [Weir1972]_. He
did this with two sets of experiments 1) identification of the uncontrolled
dynamics of the motorcycle under perturbations and 2) identification of the
rider controller during roll stabilization tasks, the latter of which will be
discussed in the next section.

His initial experiments were aimed at validating and identifying the passive
motorcycle system. During these experiments, his subjects road a motorcycle
with their bodies rigidly braced to the frame and hands-free at speeds of 15,
30, and 45 mph (6.7, 13.4, and 20.1 m/s) along side a pace car which recorded
the output from roll angle, roll rate, and steer angle sensors. The brace and
open loop response allowed rigid rider modeling assumptions to be used.
Weights were dropped from one side of the motorcycle to induce a step roll
torque and the rider used a single pulse in steering torque to the handlebars
to right the motorcycle in roll after the drop. These experiments were
impressively dangerous and would be hard pressed for approval by the
Institutional Review Board if done today, but well designed for the typical
modeling assumptions. The resulting time histories of the measured system
outputs were compared to simulations of Sharp's model [Sharp1971]_ augmented
with a variety of tire models of Eaton's design. He found good agreement
between the experiments and the models for higher speeds, but felt that a more
robust tire model was needed to predict the wobble mode in slower speed runs.

The second set of experiments were more tame. The three riders simply balanced
the motorcycle on a straight path at two speeds, 15 mph and 30 mph, for a total
of 38 runs. He added a steer torque transducer bar above the handlebars. The
rider controlled the motorcycle with one hand and the rider applied torque was
recorded along with the other signals. No perturbations were necessary, as the
rider's natural control actions excited the system in a wide enough bandwidth.
From this data he was able to identify the motorcycle steer torque to roll
angle transfer function through the spectral densities of the measured signals
(by dividing the cross spectrum of the roll angle and steer torque signal by
the power spectrum of the steer torque). The identified transfer functions show
good agreement with the augmented Sharp motorcycle model at the 30 mph speeds,
less so for the 15 mph runs.

His generated frequency responses from the second experiments provided an
empirical model, while the simulation comparisons from the first experiments
were validation rather than identification.

Weir, Zellner, Teper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Weir, Zellner, and Teper performed an extensive experimental study on
motorcycle handling qualities for the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration in the late 70's, [Weir1979a]_. This was a follow up to both the
CALSPAN studies and [Taguchi1975]_ both under or related to the same
administration. There is litte to no explicit system identification in the
study but some important elements are there. In terms of the passive model
identification they present steady state comparisons of their experimental data
to their models with varying degrees of qualitative agreement and generally
good ability to predict the conditions at which sign reversals in torque are
needed to maintain a steady turn. They also compare single lane change
simulations of a controlled vehicle to their measured data by visual
inspection. They unfortunately admit that adjusting the first principles models
to better fit their measured data was outside the scope of the project. But
this gives some early examples of model evaluation with respect to good quality
data.

James
~~~~~

Stephen James published a study in 2002 [James2002]_ in which he attempted to
identify the linear dynamics of an off-road motorcycle. He measured steering
torque, steer angle, speed, roll rate and yaw rate while his subjects manually
exciting the vehicle through steer torque during runs at various speeds on a
straight single lane road. He made use of black box ARX SIMO identification
routines of 6th and 7th order (his and others motorcycles models are usually
10th+ order) to tease out the weave and wobble eigenvalues. He compares the
identified eigenvalues, eigenvectors and frequency responses to his motorcycle
model and claims good fits based on visual interpretation of the plots. The
agreement is questionable due to the lack of statistics in the model
comparisons and little validation of his first principles model which assumes a
rigid rider. The study does show that there is the possibility of
identification of multiple modes of motion with simple manual excitation of the
handlebars. He also used these techniques to identify the same motorbike with
a single wheel trailer in [James2005]_.

Biral et al.
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Biral2003]_ performed a nice study to identify the motorcycle dynamics under
an oscillatory steer torque input. They measured steer torque, roll rate, steer
angle, and yaw rate with an instrumented motorcycle. They performed slalom
maneuvers at speeds from 2 to 30 m/s at three sets of cone spacings in the
slalom course. The resulting time histories were close to ideal sinusoids. They
used curve fitting to find amplitude and phase relationships among the measured
signals. The results were plotted on Bode plots for comparison to the frequency
response of several first principles models. The models predict the
experimental data and their motorcycle model is shown to do a better job than
other models from literature. This claim is only based on visual inspection. I
would say this technique and others like it are more of an ad hoc method of
system identification of the vehicle dynamics because they rely heavily on very
specific input and output characteristics, but never-the-less seems to be
effective. Making use of formal system identification techniques could
potentially give more reliable results and the ability to better characterize
the uncertainty in the predictions.

Kooijman
~~~~~~~~

Jodi Kooijman has worked on experimental validation of the benchmark bicycle
[Meijaard2007]_ linear equations of motion for a riderless bicycle
[Kooijman2006]_, [Kooijman2008]_, [Kooijman2009]_. His instrumented bicycle
measured the steer angle, forward speed, roll rate, and yaw rate. Due to the
fact that the bicycle can be stable at certain speeds he was able to launch the
bicycle in and around the stable speed range and perturb the bicycle with a
lateral unmeasured impulse and record the stable decay in the steer, roll, and
yaw rates. The post perturbation time histories of the measured signals
provided nice decaying oscillations and curves could be fit to find both the
time constant and frequency of oscillation. These were then compared to the
predicted weave response based on the first principle model numerically
populated with measured physical parameters of the bicycle. He found good
prediction abilities of the weave mode between 4 and 6 m/s. The "goodness" of
fit were gaged by visual inspection with no uncertainty estimates in the models
or the results from the dynamic measurements. The method was not able to
predict the heavily damped caster mode nor the capsize mode. He also
demonstrated that the measured dynamics were the same when the experiments were
performed on a treadmill.

In [Kooijman2011]_, Jodi constructed a bicycle with very unusual physical
characteristics including negative trail and canceled angular momentum of the
wheels. He performed similar experiments as his Master's thesis work. They show
the comparison of a single stable experiment in which the yaw and roll rates
were measured and compared it to the predictions of the benchmark bicycle.

[Stevens2009]_ and [Escolana2011]_ both perform experiments similar to
Kooijman's with similar results, although Steven's results vary in the ability
of the model to predict the data for various configurations of his adjustable
bicycle.

These also fall into the ad hoc system identification techniques that take
advantage of the stability at certain speeds and very specific output
characteristics. The variability in reproducibility in the studies from other
researchers should be noted.

Chen and Doa
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Chen2010]_ develop a first principles non-linear bicycle model with a fuzzy
controller and use it to generate stable simulations for various speeds. He
then does an output error grey box identification on the resulting data with
respect to the non-zero and non-unity entries of the state, input and output
matrices (i.e. just the entries of the acceleration equations). The
identification is done for a discrete number of speeds in the range 1 to 15
m/s. The eigenvalues are calculated of the resulting identified speed dependent
A matrices and the root locus plotted versus speed.

The resulting eigenvalues seem to behave like the benchmark bicycle but the
capsize mode is shown to go unstable briefly at a speed lower than the stable
speed range. They did not attempt to characterize or identify the process noise
even though they generated the data with a known model with known input noise.
Also their non-linear bicycle equations of motion [Chen2006]_ were never
validated against any other accepted models. Both of these can potentially
explain the discrepancies in their identification. Their identification
procedure does show that it may be possible to get good estimates of a linear
model of the vehicle alone from noisy data regardless of the controller which
stabilizes the vehicle.

Doria
~~~~~

In [Doria2012]_ experiments are performed where a motorcycle rider excites the
steering with a pulse and lets the motorcycle oscillate while the rider keeps
his hands on the handlebars (as opposed to Eaton's hands-free experiments). The
resulting dynamical measurements are nice decaying sinusoidal-like motions of
which the authors fit ideal curves to the data. They identify the time
constants, frequency, and phase information to construct the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the excited mode. The empirically derived eigenvectors show
some resemblance to the model's predictions.

Controller Identification
-------------------------

van Lunteren and Stassen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At Delft University of Technology in the Man-Machines research group, Drs. van
Lunteren and Stassen began work in 1962 to identify the human controller for a
normal population of subjects and report on their work into the early 70's
([Lunteren1967]_, [Lunteren1969]_, [Stassen1969]_, [Lunteren1970]_,
[Lunteren1970a]_, [Lunteren1970b]_, [Luntern1973]_, [Stassen1973]_). They chose
a bicycle simulator as the plant because it was a common task that average
people could do and their studies could focus on a wider population of
individuals as compared to most previous work based around trained pilots. The
bicycle simulator did not capture all of the essential dynamics of a real
bicycle as it's operation was based on only the simplified roll dynamics of
Whipple's model, but nonetheless offered a similarly complex roll stabilization
control task as a normal bicycle would. The simulator was controlled by both
the steering angle and the rider's lean angle, both of which are questionable
inputs as have been pointed out as early as [Roland1972]_.

They assumed the rider's control actions can be described by a PID controller
with time delays on each feedback variable and mention that this controller was
chosen instead of a McRuer style controller primarily due to limitations of
their computational equipment. The error in the roll angle is fed into two PID
controllers each with a time delay: one to output the corrective steer angle
and the other to output the corrective lean angle. They introduce a remnant
term for each control action and the external disturbances to the bicycle
model.

The identification goal was to find the six gains and two time delays in which
the controller performed as a human would. The preferred method was a real time
estimation routine due to the speed of computations and reasonable agreement
their correlation method. The results indicated that the subjects used no
integral control (i.e. only position and rate feedback). They could identify
within a bandwidth of about 2 Hz and noticed that when the system was
undisturbed their was a 0.5 Hz dominant frequency in the rider's control
actions. The rate feedback was more dominant in generating the lean control
input than it was for the steer control input. Also, they found the time delay
for lean to be larger than the steer time delay and postulate that the steer
action is a result of cerebral activity while the lean is more of reflex
pattern. Another finding resulting from analysis of Nyquist plots of different
rider's identified control actions showed that riders chose different control
actions. They attribute this to the roll stabilization being a sub-critical
task (i.e. a more difficult task may force different riders to adopt similar
control behavior). They also investigated the effects of drugs, such as
alcohol, to the riders control behavior. They found correlations from drug dose
to time delays and the error in the control actions. Their later studies
introduced better identification methods and they found discrepancies in the
identified time delays of the later work as compared to the newer work. For
example, the steer control time delay was originally found to be around 1.5
seconds and the improved methods found the delay to be around 0.7 seconds, and
the discrepancy attributed to the bias due to remnant in their early work. They
also introduced a visual tracking task into the simulator but had difficulties
in getting reliable transfer function identification as compared to the roll
stabilization transfer functions which improved in quality due to longer trials
of 35 minutes.

The methods developed in their studies are great and thorough examples of early
parameter identification in human control tasks. The simpler plant dynamics
were most likely beneficial at reducing the uncertainty in the identified
parameters, but the choice of angles as inputs instead forces of torques may
not be a realistic enough model of the human's actuation control response and
actuation.

Eaton
~~~~~

After feeling confident in his motorcycle identification results, Eaton made
use of the Wingrove-Edwards method in tandem with an impulse identification to
identify the human controller. The remnant element was large with respect to
the torque that was linearly correlated with the roll angle, but the human
control element was identified with a simple gain and time delay for most of
the high speed runs. The time delay identification of about 0.3 seconds was
very repeatable across all runs. Furthermore, he demonstrated that the
crossover model was evident in the resulting closed loop rider-motorcycle
transfer functions.

Eaton is one of very few who have identified the rider controller during actual
single track vehicle tests with confidence in the underlying passive
rider-vehicle model. This study has influenced the work in the Chapter in many
ways.

Doyle
~~~~~

A recently uncovered study on the manual control of a bicycle from a
psychologist's perspective has some very non-traditional techniques and
outlooks to the understanding of the control system employed while balancing a
bicycle [Doyle1987]_. Anthony Dolye's paper [Doyle1988]_ on his thesis topic
opens with "The old saw says that once learned it is never forgotten, but what
exactly is learned has been by no means clear." This reflection points to the
great complexity behind balancing a bicycle, such an easily gained skill. He
chooses to study the bicycle over a simpler task partially due to the fact that
the rider has little freedom in effective control strategies and partially
because it is a skill many people can do.

His goal was to determine how much of the rider's control actions can be
accounted for without involving higher cerebral functions. He mentions the Weir
and Zellner work and the fact that its focus is on  motorcycles at high speed,
and questions whether the control employed for their system is simply a
different version of the one employed on a bicycle at low speed or whether they
are different control methodologies all together.

He was aware of the inherent stability that bicycles can provide and constructs
an instrumented bicycle where the head angle, trail, and front wheel gyro
effects are eliminated so that "all steer movements are a result of the human's
control". He also mentions, but doesn't use, a body brace to eliminate
unnecessary body movements and he blindfolds his subjects so that their sensory
information is limited to proprioception and vestibular cues. He mentions the
arm and upper body movements and how it is difficult to tease out the
deliberate movements versus the passive dynamics of the body. With the
instrumented bicycle he conducts low speed steady turn and balancing tasks and
measures speed, roll rate, and steer angle.

Along with the experimental data, he developed a bicycle and rider model with
accompanying controller. The bicycle derivation of the bicycle model is
questionable due to the non-traditional methods, but he does end up with a
model which behaves like a bicycle including speed dependent stability. He is
aware of the need to roll the bicycle frame in the direction of the desired
turn for directional control and how counter-steering plays a roll in this.
This concept leads to the primary inner loop being chosen as roll control and
his control structure resembles that of Weir's work in terms of sequential
loops. He cites the crossover model and is aware that humans can adjust their
gains as needed for good performance. The controller is traditional in most
senses and follows the patterns by McRuer, Weir, and Eaton but he adds in the
ability to add discrete pulses to the roll angle. He feeds back roll
acceleration and integrates it to get roll angular velocity. This is basically
a continuous PD control on roll rate. But his non-continuous addition to the
controller is based on a fuzzy logic-like rule "Make a pulse against the lean
whenever it gets bigger that 1.6 degrees."

It seems like he gets somewhat close matches to the experimental traces from
his control model simulations without the discrete pulses, but then adds in
pulses (single or multiple) to the steering so that the traces matches more
closely. His identification technique and criterion is focused around a
detailed examination of the patterns in the time histories in a very
qualitative way.

His results focus around the evidence for intermittent control and finds the
traditional gains to be inversely proportional to speed. He claims the
balancing part of the control system is done primarily in the lower cortex.

To me, Doyle's work emphasizes the need for close collaboration between
psychologists and control engineers to formalize the theory for human balance.
His intermittent control theory may be valid, but due to the unusual model
development, simulation and analyses techniques it is hard to gage whether the
need for intermittent control was simply artifact of poor modeling. His insight
into the human control theory is very enlightening and his ways of wording
bring the theory outside of the traditional control framework for an expansion
in understanding.

Lange
~~~~~

Peter de Lange's recent Master thesis work [Lange2011]_ focused on identifying
the rider controller from the data that he helped us collect while interning at
our lab. He used the Whipple bicycle model, a simplified second order
representation of the human's neuromuscular dynamics (natural frequency 2.17
rad/s and damping ratio of 1.414) and a PID like controller with a 0.03 second
time delay. The controller structure had gains proportional to the integral of
the angle, the angle, the angular rate and the angular acceleration for roll
and steer. The control task was defined as simple roll stabilization (i.e.
track a roll angle of zero degrees), even though the data was collected during
heading and roll tracking tasks.

He used a four step process for identifying the rider controller 1) he
"removed" the human remnant by averaging the time histories over several single
perturbations, 2) he identified a very high order finite impulse response model
(only a function previous inputs) for the lateral force to steer angle SISO
pair (lateral perturbation force input and steer angle as output) 3) low pass
filtered the resulting responses, and 4) he identified the rider controller
parameters with a grey box model using the filtered FIR simulation results as
the base data. The grey box model was parameterized with eight gains and a time
delay. He was able to identify the gains, but the time delay always gave a
resulting unstable model, so he dropped it. Furthermore, all of the gains were
not necessary for good model predictions so he eliminated the unnecessary
gains systematically to find the critical feedback elements. These turned out
to be the gains for roll angle, roll rate, steer rate, and the integral of the
steer angle. The first three are as one may expect and he concludes that the
steer angle integral could be equated to yaw angle feedback since they are
proportional in the linear sense.

Peter's approach hinges on the averaging process in step one. The human remnant
is large relative to the measurements and averaging potentially removes data
that isn't necessarily noise. This averaging is atypical, as process noise
models are usually employed to account for these variations in the data. Using
a model such as ARMAX instead of the two step averaging and FIR model would
potentially allow one to identify the underlying linear model without removing
potentially valid data in the time history averaging process. Or all of the
steps could be combined into a state space grey box formulation with a process
noise model, for a more direct route to identifying the free parameters. But
these methods have their difficulties and will be described later in the
Chapter.

Conclusion
----------

The literature provides many examples of first principle models for both the
open loop vehicle-rider system dynamics and the rider's control, but often
proving that those models are good predictors of real physical phenomena is
difficult. These previous examples that I've presented have various
similarities influence to the methods I've chosen to use to identify the
vehicle and the rider.

Open loop identification
   The purpose of the open loop identification is to identify the passive
   vehicle and rider dynamics. This includes the force and kinematic
   relationships of the bicycle or motorcycle and if a rider is present the
   passive dynamics of the rider's body motion. Their are two basic approaches
   that have been used in literature.

   Mode Excitation
      This involves identifying particular modes of motion by forcing the
      system such that those modes are excited. The input to the vehicle is
      typically limited to a narrow bandwidth. The forcing can be generated
      manually from human control, by external perturbations, or by function of
      the maneuver. The techniques are best at identifying sustained
      oscillatory modes. Decaying oscillations are fit to the data and to
      extract time constants, frequency, and phase shift for various
      input-output combinations. These techniques generally give good
      repeatable results, but limited to identifying single modes and require
      many experiments to get a spread in frequency content and vehicle speed.
      These methods are also limited to identifying the open loop dynamics.
   Excitation
      Many modes of a model can be excited if proper inputs to the vehicle are
      chosen, giving the opportunity to identify more complete dynamic models.
      Frequency sweeps, white noise, and sum of sines are good candidates for a
      broad input spectrum. And it turns out that the remnant associated with
      human control and or deliberate random manual excitation can provide a
      wide bandwidth input spectrum as shown in [Eaton1973]_ and [James2002]_
      for adequate system identification of many modes including the higher
      frequency wobble mode. Modern system identification techniques can be
      used to find models and identify physical parameters.

Rider Control Identification (closed loop, active)
   Few have attempted to identify the rider as a control element in the bicycle
   or motorcycle system. The large array of potential control actions from a
   unconstrained rider is extremely difficult to measure, especially when both
   the forces and kinematics are key to proper identification. Typically,
   limits are put on how the rider can actuate the system and in some cases
   limits are put on the rider's ability to sense the system. This is somewhat
   critical so that the system is much more tractable. Similar to the open loop
   excitation techniques, a broad frequency spectrum provides better data to
   work for identification purposes. [Lange2011]_ has a good overview of
   excitation ideas.

   The open dynamics are in some sense much easier to model with first
   principles, as the theory is much more mature. On the other hand, the
   theoretical constructs of the control system of the human is relatively in its
   infancy, so having the advantage of solid first principles is much weaker.
   Most researchers' approaches have been modeled from the manual control work
   lead by authors such as Tustin and McRuer in the 50s and 60s. When mapped to
   the bicycle, the primary control loop is taken as roll stabilization and roll
   command authority. With the secondary loops being heading and tracking. Both
   sequential loop controller designs and the popular PID controllers have been
   used as a structure for gain and delay parameter identification in the
   control loops.

   Accurate parameter identification relies on strong characterization of the
   system process noise and in the case of a human rider, the process noise is
   often comparable in magnitude and frequency to the control actions
   themselves. Techniques that treat the controller as a quasi-linear structure
   where the noise is modeled as white and Gaussian and characterized by the
   portion of the output not linear correlated to the input (i.e. remnant) have
   been popular in past. [Eaton1973]_ took care to account for this and found
   that the crossover model was a good predictor of human control action. A
   proper treatment of the noise by other researchers is typically little to
   none and justly so as it is not necessarily easily dealt with large
   signal-to-noise ratios in the linear control framework. Modern system
   identification techniques offer some ability to model process noise with
   ARMAX types of implementations and state space formulations benefiting from
   the integration with Kalman filters. As will be discussed in the following
   sections, model identification works fairly well but parameter
   identification such as those for control gains becomes increasingly
   difficult with higher noise.

Experimental Design
===================

Our main experimental designs were focused around reasonable ways to excite the
rider/bicycle system with the goal of identifying the parameters of the rider
control system. I started by simply repeating some of the perturbation
experiments from Chapters :ref:`delftbicycle` and :ref:`motioncapture`, but
included and measured the lateral perturbation force and the steer torque which
were critical measurements for a realistic input/output relationships that the
previous studies lacked. We also attempted single lane change maneuvers because
we'd been using a lane change as our objective criteria in our simulations
[Hess2012]_ and they had been used successfully used in the literature. It
turned out that we were able to get reasonable results with preliminary system
identification with the lateral perturbation runs and did not pursue the lane
change maneuvers beyond the preliminary runs. The lane changes were especially
difficult on the narrow treadmill.

Riders
------

We chose three riders: Charlie, Jason, and Luke of similar age: 34, 28-29, 32,
mass: 79, 84, 84 kg and bicycling ability although Luke has more technical
mountain biking skill other two riders. A wide range of skill levels were outside
the scope of the project and we preferred riders with good proficiency as it
has been shown that it increases repeatability of results in tasks such as
these [Weir1979a]_. The seat height and harness were set in the same position
for Charlie and Luke and in different positions for Jason. The inertia of the
rear frame was measured for both configurations (thus the "Rigidcl" and "Rigid"
bicycles) in Chapter :ref:`physicalparameters`.

Environments
------------

We performed the experiments in two different environments: on a treadmill and in
a large gymnasium.

Treadmill
~~~~~~~~~

Dr. James Jones at the veterinary school at here at Davis graciously let us use
their horse treadmill (Graber Ag Kagra Mustang 2200) during their downtime,
:ref:`Figure 1 <figHorseTreadmill>`. The treadmill is 1 meter wider and 5
meters long and has a speed range from 0.5 m/s to 17 m/s. This was only a third
of the width treadmill at Vrije Universitiet in Amsterdam, but after some
practice runs we felt that narrow lane changes and the lateral perturbations
could be successfully performed. We used the treadmill because the environment
was very controllable, in particular with regards to fixed constant speeds, and
it offered the ability to do have very long run durations within a broad speed
range. Potentially both the side railings and the belt side curbs added to
rider's lack of lateral movement space.

Pavilion
~~~~~~~~

The bicycle was designed in such a way that all of the data collection
equipment was on board and was suitable for data collection in a free
environment. After lengthy bureaucratic negotiations, we were able to make use
of the UCD pavilion floor for the experiments, :ref:`Figure 2 <figPavilion>`.
The floor was made of a stiff rubber [#pavilionfloor]_ and provided a
rectangular wind free space of about 100' by 180' (30 m by 55 m). We road
around the perimeter to build up speed and did our maneuvers on a straight
section about 100 feet (30 m) long.  We were not able to travel at speeds
higher than about 7 m/s as the tires would slip in the final turn into the test
section (this seemed to be due to the dust on the floor). This in door
environment provided a wind free area which was more akin to the environment
bicyclists normally ride in.

Maneuvers
---------

Our choice of maneuvers was primarily guided by our previous experiments and
the search for an optimal way to externally excite the system. We also made
sure to perform sets of experiments that would act as a control without
deliberate disturbances. The following list details the meaning of the maneuver
labels in the dataset.

System Test
   This is a generic label for data collected during various system tests that
   should not be used for general analysis. This was primarily used to check
   that all sensors were working before each set of experiments.
Balance
   The rider is instructed to simply balance the bicycle and keep a relatively
   straight heading. They were instructed to focus on a point of their choosing
   in the far distance. There was an open door in front of the treadmill which
   allowed the rider to look to a point outside across the street. In the
   pavilion, the rider looked into the rafters of the building or at the
   furthest wall. We may have given slightly different instructions to the
   riders and Charlie did not understand the instructions exactly during some
   of the earlier runs, but nonetheless these can be analyzed with a control
   model that only has the roll and heading loops closed and maybe even with
   only the roll loop closed. We had a line taped to the pavilion floor during
   these runs that was still in the periphery of the rider's vision. This may
   have affected their heading control.
Balance With Disturbance
   Same as 'Balance' except that a lateral force perturbation is applied just
   under the seat of the bicycle. The rider wore a face shield on the side of
   the perturber so no visual cues were available to predict the perturbation
   time or direction. On the treadmill, we sample for 60 to 90 seconds with
   five to eleven perturbations per run. On the pavilion floor we were able to
   apply two to four perturbations per run due to the length of the track. In
   the early runs (< 204), the lateral force was applied only in the negative
   direction (to the left) and the perturber decided when to apply the
   perturbations. For the later runs (> 203), we applied a random sequence of
   positive and negative perturbations that was unknown to the rider. On the
   treadmill, the rider signaled when they felt stable and the perturbation was
   applied at a random time between 0 and 1 second based on a simple computer
   program. On the pavilion floor, we simply applied the perturbations as soon
   as the rider felt stable so that we could get in as many as possible during
   each run.
Track Straight Line
   The rider was instructed to focus on a straight line that was marked on the
   ground and he attempted to keep the front wheel on the line. The line of
   sight from the rider's eyes to the line on the ground was essentially
   tangent the top of the front wheel. In the pavilion, the line could be seen
   up to 100 feet ahead, so there was greater peripheral view of the line. On
   the treadmill, there was from 0.5 to 1.5 meters of preview line available.
Track Straight Line With Disturbance
   Same as "Track Straight Line" except that a lateral perturbation force is
   applied to the seat of the bicycle. This was done in the same fashion as
   described in "Balance With Disturbance".
Lane Change
   The rider attempted to track a line in similar fashion as the "Track
   Straight Line" maneuver except that the line was a single lane change. On
   the pavilion floor, the line was taped on the ground and the rider was
   instructed to do whatever felt best to stay on the line :ref:`Figure 3
   <figPavilionLaneChange>`. They could use full preview looking ahead, focus
   on the front wheel and line, or a combination of both. We also tried some
   lane changes on the treadmill but the lack of preview of the line made it
   especially difficult. We were able to manage it by marking a count down on
   the belt so that the rider new when the lane change would arrive. The rider
   also new the direction of lane change before hand for all the scenarios.
Blind With Disturbance
   We did a run or two for each rider on the pavilion floor with the rider's
   eyes closed to attempt to completely open the heading loop. In hindsight,
   blind tests would be preferable when identifying the rider control system so
   that only inner roll stabilization loop need be analyzed.
Static Calibration
   We took a short duration sample of the sensors signals while no rider was on
   the bicycle and the bicycle was fixed as close to vertical in roll before
   each set of runs. The static accelerometer readings could theoretically give
   the roll and pitch angles of the bicycle frame and be used to account for
   the bias in the roll angle measurements.

   115-139.

I only focus on the Balance and Track Straight Line maneuvers with and without
disturbances in the following analyses and they will be referred to as Heading
Tracking and Lateral Deviation Tracking in the text (as opposed to the labels
in the database).

Heading Tracking
    The rider was instructed to simply balance the bicycle and keep a
    relatively constant heading while focusing their vision at a point
    in the far distance.
Lateral Deviation Tracking
    The rider was instructed to focus on a straight line that was marked
    on the ground and to attempt to keep the front wheel on the line.

Both tasks were performed with and without the application of a manually
applied lateral perturbation force just below the seat. The forces were
applied randomly in direction and time.

Data
====

The experimental data was collected on seven different days. The first few days
were mostly trials to test out the equipment, procedures and different
maneuvers. The data from the trial days is valid data and we ended up using it
in our analysis. The tires were pumped to 100 psi at the start of each day.

February 4 2011 Runs 103-109
   These were the first trials on the treadmill for preliminary testing. Only
   Jason rode. We performed lateral deviation tracking with disturbances. The
   bike fell over, broke and we had to cut it short.
February 28, 2011 Run 115-170
   These were the first trials in the pavilion. Jason was the only rider. We
   tried lane changes (115-139), lateral deviation tracking with disturbances
   (140-157), and a mixture of heading tracking and lateral deviation tracking
   with no disturbances (158-170). I noted that the slip clutch backlash seemed
   to be larger than the previous day with a guess of about 1 degree.
March 9, 2011 Runs 180-204
   This was the second go at the treadmill, still just testing out things.
   Jason was the only rider. We did heading and lateral deviation tracking with
   disturbances and some lane changes. The lane changes were 0.25 m wide left
   and right maneuvers back and forth among two lines on the treadmill at 2 m
   long segments. Countdown markers to give an idea when the lane change
   started were necessary due to the rider's limited preview distance. We did
   the highest speed during any subsequent trials at 9 m/s. The 9 m/s runs
   acquired a large amount of noise in the lateral force channel. The treadmill
   elevation was set at 0.1% grade.
August 30, 2011 Runs 235-291
   Jason and Luke rode and performed heading and lateral deviation tasks with
   and without perturbations at three speeds on the treadmill.
September 6, 2011 Runs 295-318
   Charlie performed heading and lateral deviation tasks with and without
   perturbations on the treadmill.
September 9, 2011 Runs 325-536
   Luke, Charlie and Jason performed heading and lateral deviation tracking
   tasks on the Pavilion floor with and without perturbations. Most of Luke and
   Charlie's runs were corrupt due to the time synchronization issues.
September 21, 2011 Runs 538-706
   Luke and Charlie repeated the runs from September 9th. And we added a couple
   of blind runs for each of them.

The meta data and raw time history data for each run and all sensor calibration
data were stored in individual Matlab mat files on the data acquisition
computer with my `BicycleDAQ <https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleDAQ>`_
software. The run files and calibration files are automatically numbered in
sequence with a five digit number; one sequence for runs and one for
calibrations. These mat files were then parsed and merged into a HDF5 database
for a uniform, organized, and complete single database that could be accessed by
a number of programs and languages for fast data queries. I made use of
`PyTables <http://www.pytables.org>`_ for writing and reading from the
database. The software `BicycleDataProcessor
<http://github.com/moorepants/BicycleDataProcessor>`_ was designed as an
interface to the data in the database. In particular, it is able to load the raw
data from individual runs, process it, and present it for easy manipulation and
viewing.

The database is initially structured with three top level tables and nodes
containing the time histories of the sensors for each run. The run table has a
row for each run and the columns store each piece of meta data, including the
corruption coding described below. The signal table has a row for each raw and
processed signal type and the classification information for each. The
calibration table has a row for each calibration which provides information
about the sensor and the data collected in the calibration.

We recorded a large set of meta data for each run to help with parsing during
analyses. We also video recorded all of the runs (minus a few video mishaps).
I coded each run based on the notes, data quality, and viewing the video for
potential or definite corrupted data with the following five codes.

Corrupt
   If the data is completely unusable due to time synchronization issues or
   other then this is set to true.
Warning
   Runs with a warning flag are questionable and potentially not usable.
Knee
   The rider's knees would sometimes de-clip from the frame during a
   perturbation. This potentially invalidates the rigid rider assumption. An
   array of 15 boolean values are stored for each run and each true value
   represents a perturbation where a knee came off.
Handlebar
   On the treadmill the bicycle handlebars occasionally connected with the side
   railings. Each perturbation during the run which this happen was recorded.
Trailer
   On the treadmill the roll trailer occasionally connected with the side of
   the treadmill. Each perturbation during the run which this happened was
   recorded.

We ultimately collected 600+ runs that were potentially usable for analysis.
:ref:`Figure 4 <figDataBarPlots>` gives a breakdown of the runs by rider,
environment, maneuvers, and speed bins.

The processed data provides filtered signals that correspond to the coordinates
and speeds outlined in our models, Chapters :ref:`eom` and :ref:`extensions`.
We were even able to estimate the path of the wheel contact points on the
ground. The quality of the data is high with little to no missing data and

System Identification
=====================

My primary goal in the following analyses of all the collected data is to
identify the manual control system employed the rider. I will approach this in
a similar fashion as [Eaton1973]_ and attempt to identify the open loop bicycle
and rider dynamics first and follow by with identification of the control
system.

This two part process was not originally thought to be needed and I started
with the identification of the control system assuming the Whipple model would
be adequate for the open loop dynamics. But my preliminary attempts at
identifying the controller with the Whipple model in place as the plant always
under-predicted the steer torque needed for a given measured trajectory. This
lead me into the exploration of the validity of the Whipple model.

There is actually very little experimental validation of the open loop dynamics
of the bicycle with [Kooijman2006]_ being one of the better studies.  But his
study was limited to a riderless bicycle in a narrow speed range where the
bicycle was stable. Taking the various first principles models like this for
granted is potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions. In our case, it resulted
in erroneous early estimations of the controller parameters. As pointed out by
many, in particular the motorcycle crowd, there is very good reason to question
some of assumptions such as knife edge, no side slip wheels especially under a
rider's weight. And secondly, the rider's biomechanics have much more influence
and coupling to the bicycle than the motorcycle, which must be accounted for.

After a model for the open loop system is derived I identify parameters to the
control structure described in [Hess2012]_ and in Chapter :ref:`control`. We've
shown that this control structure is robust for a range of speeds and lends
itself to the dictates of the crossover model which is built upon strong
experimental evidence in human operator modeling. I make use of multi-input
multi-output grey box state space identification techniques to home in on the
optimal parameters for the measured data.

Before I proceed, it is important to note the difference in identifying a model
that best predicts the data versus identifying physical parameters in a model
structure that cause the data to best fit the measured data. In the first case,
it is somewhat easy to fit a model to input and output data. By increasing the
order of the model and thus the number of free parameters one can theoretically
fit every data point. This is most evident in the over-fitting of a linear
trend with that of a higher order polynomial. It still often takes human
intuition and reasoning to limit the order of the system to something that
represents the true relationships in the variables. But even in this case, the
individual meaning of the resulting identified parameters of black box system
may have little apparent connection to the known first principles laws we are
familiar with and trust in. In dynamics, we often want to know how well our
first principles models predict the measured motion and secondly we'd like the
ability to identify parameters, particular ones we uncertain of, in the first
principles models from measured data. Accurately identifying model parameters
is much more difficult task, as noise, both process and measurement, have to be
accounted for to get repeatable and accurate estimates of the parameters. I
have had good success with finding models that predict the data but little
success with explicit and accurate parameter identification in the following
analyses. There is great room for improvement in the parameter identification
if the noise issues are better managed.

Bicycle Model Validity
======================

The open loop dynamics of the bicycle-rider system can be described with many
models, see [Astrom2005]_, [Limebeer2006]_, and [Meijaard2007]_ for good
overviews. The benchmarked Whipple model [Meijaard2007]_ provides a somewhat
minimalistic model in a manageable analytic framework which is capable of
describing the essential dynamics such as speed dependent stability, steer and
roll coupling, and non-minimal phase behavior. I use this model as the standard
base model to work from, as the fidelity of simpler models are generally not
adequate. The model is 4th order with roll angle, steer angle, roll rate and
steer rate typically selected as the independent states and with roll and steer
torque as inputs. I neglect the roll torque input and in its place extend the
model to include a lateral force acting at a point on the frame to provide a
new input, accurately modelling lateral perturbations, see Chapter
:ref:`extensions` for the details. I also examine a second candidate model
which adds inertial effects of the rider's arms to the Whipple model, also in
Chapter :ref:`extensions`. This model was designed to more accurately account
for the fact that the riders were free to move their arms with the front frame
of the bicycle. This model is similar in fashion to the upright rider in
[Schwab2010a]_, but with slightly different joint definitions. Constraints are
chosen so that no additional degrees of freedom are added, keeping the system
both tractable and comparable to the benchmarked Whipple model.

I estimated the physical parameters of the first principles models with the
techniques described in Chapter :ref:`physicalparameters`. The bicycle was
measured to get accurate estimates of the parameters used in the benchmark
bicycle. Each rider's inertial properties were estimated using Yeadon's
[Yeadon1990]_ method which allowed easy extraction of body segment parameters
for more complicated rider biomechanic models such as the inclusion of moving
arms as described above. The parameter computation is handled with two custom
open source software packages [Dembia2011]_ and [Moore2011]_.

.. _secStateSpaceID:

State Space Realization
-----------------------

During all of the experiments there are two measured external (or exogenous)
inputs: the steer torque and the lateral force. Both inputs are generated
manually, the first from the rider and the second from the person applying the
pulsive perturbation. The outputs can be any subset of the measured kinematical
variables or combinations thereof. The problem can then be formulated as such:
given the inputs and outputs of the system and some system structure, what
model parameters give the best prediction of the output given the measured
input. This a classic system identification problem.

Method
~~~~~~

For this analysis, I limit the inputs to steer torque and lateral force and the
outputs to roll angle, steer angle, roll rate, and steer rate. The ideal fourth
order system can be described with the following continuous state space
description

.. math::
   :label: eqConStateSpace

   \dot{x}(t) & =
   \mathbf{F}x(t) + \mathbf{G}u(t)\\
   \begin{bmatrix}
     \dot{\phi} \\
     \dot{\delta} \\
     \ddot{\phi} \\
     \ddot{\delta}
   \end{bmatrix}
   & =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
     a_{\ddot{\phi}\phi} & a_{\ddot{\phi}\delta} &
     a_{\ddot{\phi}\dot{\phi}} & a_{\ddot{\phi}\dot{\delta}}\\
     a_{\ddot{\delta}\phi} & a_{\ddot{\delta}\delta} &
     a_{\ddot{\delta}\dot{\phi}} & a_{\ddot{\delta}\dot{\delta}}
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
     \phi \\
     \delta \\
     \dot{\phi} \\
     \dot{\delta}
   \end{bmatrix}
   +
   \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & 0 \\
     0 & 0\\
     b_{\ddot{\phi}T_\delta} & b_{\ddot{\phi}F_{c_l}}\\
     b_{\ddot{\delta}T_\delta} & b_{\ddot{\delta}F_{c_l}}
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
     T_\delta\\
     F_{c_l}
   \end{bmatrix}\\
   \eta(t) & = \mathbf{H}x(t)\\

where :math:`\eta(t)` are the outputs and :math:`\mathbf{H}` is the identity matrix.

Assuming that this model structure can adequately capture the dynamics of
interest of the bicycle-rider system, our goal is to accurately identify the
unknown parameters :math:`\theta` which are made up of the unspecified entries
in the :math:`\mathbf{F}` and :math:`\mathbf{G}` matrices. To do this one needs
to recognize that this continuous formulation is not compatible with noisy
discrete data. The following difference equation can be assumed if we sample
the continuous system at :math:`t=kT`, :math:`k=1,2,\dots`, with :math:`T`
being the sample period and the assumption that the variables are constant
over the sample period (i.e. zero order hold).

.. math::
   :label: eqDisStateSpace

   x(kT + T) & = \mathbf{A}(\theta)x(kT) + \mathbf{B}(\theta)u(kT) + w(kT)\\
   y(kT) & = \mathbf{C}(\theta)x(kT) + v(kT)

The additional terms :math:`w` and :math:`v` represent the process and
measurement noise vectors, respectively, which are assumed to be sequences of
white Gaussian noise with zero mean and some covariance. By making use of the
Kalman filter this formulation can be transformed such that the optimal
estimate of the states with respect to the process and measurement noise
covariance :math:`\hat{x}` are utilized, see [Ljung1999]_.

.. math::
   :label: eqInnovations

   \hat{x}(kT + T, \theta) & = \mathbf{A}(\theta)\hat{x}(kT) +
   \mathbf{B}(\theta)u(kT) + \mathbf{K}(\theta)e(kT)\\

   y(kT) & = \mathbf{C}(\theta)\hat{x}(kT) + e(kT)

where :math:`\mathbf{K}` is the Kalman gain matrix. :math:`\mathbf{K}` is a
function of :math:`\mathbf{A}(\theta)`, :math:`\mathbf{C}(\theta)` and the
covariance and cross covaraince of the process and measurment noise, but it can
also be directly parameterized by :math:`\theta`. With that, this equation is
called the *directly parameterized innovations form* and the entries of the four
matrices in equation :eq:`eqInnovations` can be estimated directly.

The :math:`\mathbf{A}` and :math:`\mathbf{B}` matrices are related to
:math:`\mathbf{F}` and :math:`\mathbf{G}` by

.. math::
   :label: eqDiscreteContinuous

   \mathbf{A}(\theta) = e^{\mathbf{F}(\theta)T}

   \mathbf{B}(\theta) = \int_{\tau=0}^T e^{\mathbf{F}(\theta)\tau}
   \mathbf{G}(\theta) d\tau

and with a linear assumption can even be directly estimated in discrete form by

.. math::
   :label: eqDiscreteContinuousLinear

   \mathbf{A}(\theta) = \mathbf{I} +  \mathbf{F}(\theta)T

   \mathbf{B}(\theta) = \int_{\tau=0}^T  (\mathbf{I} +  \mathbf{F}(\theta)\tau)
   \mathbf{G}(\theta) d\tau

.. todo:: Is this linear form correct?

The one step ahead predictor for the innovations form is

.. math::
   :label: eqOneStepInnovations

   \hat{y}(t|\theta) = \mathbf{C}(\theta) \left[q \mathbf{I} -
   \mathbf{A}(\theta) + \mathbf{K}(\theta) \right]^{-1}
   \left[\mathbf{B}(\theta) u(t) + \mathbf{K}(\theta)y(t) \right]

where :math:`q` is the forward shift operator (:math:`q u(t) = u(t+1)`)
[Ljung1999]_. The predictor is a vector of length :math:`p` where each entry is
a ratio of polynomials in :math:`q`. These are transfer functions in :math:`q`
from the previous inputs and outputs to the current output. In general, the
coefficients of :math:`q` are non-linear functions of the parameters
:math:`\theta`.

We can now construct the cost function, which will enable the computation of
the parameters which give the best fit using optimization methods. We'd like to
minimize the error in the predicted output with respect to the measured output
at each time step. First form :math:`Y_N` which is a :math:`pN x 1` vector
containing all of the current outputs at time :math:`kT`.

.. math::
   :label: eqCurrentOutputs

   Y_N = \left[y_1(1) \ldots y_p(1) \ldots y_1(N) \ldots y_p(N) \right]^T

where :math:`p` are the number of outputs and :math:`N` is the number of samples.
Then compute the predictor vector, :math:`\hat{Y}_N(\theta)`, the one step ahead
prediction of :math:`Y_N` given :math:`y(s)` and :math:`u(s)` where :math:`s
\leq t - 1`

.. math::
   :label: eqPredictedOuputs

   \hat{Y}_N = \left[\hat{y}_1(1) \ldots \hat{y}_1(1) \ldots \hat{y}_p(N)
   \ldots \hat{y}_p(N) \right]^T

The cost function is then the norm of the difference of :math:`Y_N` and
:math:`\hat{Y}_N(\theta)` for all :math:`k`.

.. math::
   :label: eqCostFunction

   V_N(\theta) = \frac{1}{pN}||Y_N - \hat{Y}_N(\theta)||

The value of :math:`\theta` which minimizes the cost function is the best
prediction

.. math::
   :label: eqParameterEstimate

   \hat{\theta}_N = \underset{x}{\operatorname{argmax}} V_N(\theta, Z^N)

where :math:`Z^N` is the set of all the measured inputs and outputs.

In general, the minimization problem is not trivial and may be susceptible to
many of the issues associated with optimization including local minima. The
number of unknown parameters in the :math:`\mathbf{K}` matrix are a function of
the number of states and the number of outputs, in our case in
:math:`\mathbf{R}^{4\times4}` which more than doubles the number of unknowns
present in the :math:`\mathbf{A}` and :math:`\mathbf{B}` matrices. It is thus
critical to reduce the number of unknown parameters to have a more likely
chance at finding the global minima of the cost function. The accuracy of the
system parameters depend on the ability to estimate the :math:`\mathbf{K}`
matrix along with the other parameters.

Before identification I further processed all of the signals that were
generally symmetric about zero by subtracting the means over time. For some of
the pavilion runs, this may have actually introduced a small bias, as the short
duration runs with unbalanced perturbations may not have a mean at true zero.

I made use of the Matlab System Identification Toolbox for the identification
of the parameters :math:`\theta` in each run of this model structure. In
particular a structured `idss` object was built for with the initial guesses of
the unknown parameters based on the Whipple model and the initial guesses for
the initial conditions and the Kalman gain matrix being equal to zero. All of
my attempts at identifying the Kalman gain matrix were plagued by local minima.

Results
~~~~~~~

It turns out that finding a model than which meets the criterion is not too
difficult when the output error form is considered (:math:`\mathbf{K}=0`). This
model may be able to explain the data well, but the parameter estimation is
potentially be poor because the parameters in the state and input matrices were
adjusted such that the results fit both the true trajectories *and* the noise.
Global minima in the search routine are quickly found when the number of
parameters are between 10 and 14. When the :math:`\mathbf{K}` matrix is added
the number of unknown parameters increases by 16 and the global minima becomes
more difficult to find and I was rarely able, if at all, to find the global
minima for the general problem, even when reducing the number of outputs to
one.

:ref:`Figure 7 <figExampleFit>` shows a typical example input and output data
for a single run (#596) with both steer torque and lateral force as inputs. The
plot compares the simulation response of the input to the measured response.
Notice that the identified model predicts the trajectory extremely well.
Similar results are found for the majority of the runs. The Whipple model
predicts the trajectory directions but the magnitudes are large, meaning that
for a given trajectory, the Whipple model requires less torque than what was
measured. The Whipple model with the arm inertial effects does a better job
than the Whipple model, but still has some magnitude differences. In particular
it has a harder time predicting the roll angle than the other two models.

   The example results for the identification of a single run (#596). The
   experimentally measured steer torque and lateral force are shown in the top
   two graphs. All of the signals were filtered with a 2nd order 15 hertz low
   pass Butterworth filter. The remaining four graphs show the simulation
   results for the Whipple model (W), Whipple model with the arm inertia (A),
   and the identified model for that run (I) plotted with the measured data
   (M). The percentages give the percent of variance explained by each model.

The identified models are almost always unstable due to the high weave critical
speed and even though the measured inputs stabilize the true system, they will
not necessarily stabilize the models. This poses an issue when gaging the model
quality by the percentage variance of the output data explained by the model. A
model that blows up during the simulation may not necessarily be a bad model,
but will return a very small percent variance and loose its ability to be
compared by that criteria. [Biral2003]_ and [Teerhuis2010]_ both are able to
run feed forward simulations of their motorcycle models with the measured
steering torque. They both are dealing with high speed motorcycles which
typically only have a slightly unstable capsize mode. [Teerhuis]_ uses a
controller to compensate the torque for unbounded errors so that the simulation
doesn't blow up. The method I use here is to chose short duration portions of
the runs for simulation and search for the best set of initial conditions to
keep the model stable during the duration. This generally works but there is
ultimately some incomparable runs due to this issue.

I use this structured state space output error identification procedure for a
collection of experiments (:math:`n=368`) over a range of speeds between about
1 and 9 m/s. Figures :ref:`8 <figACoefficients>` and :ref:`9
<figBCoefficients>` plot the identified coefficients of the dynamical equations
of motion (i.e. the bottom two rows of the :math:`\mathbf{F}` and
:math:`\mathbf{G}` matrices) as a function of speed for all of the experiments
using box plots. Both the Whipple (green) and arm (red) model predictions are
superimposed over top for comparison. The first notable thing is that the
coefficients seem to generally have large variance, especially as the speed
increases. Secondly, the roll acceleration equation, :math:`\ddot{\phi}`,
equation seems to be better predicted by the two models and the data has less
spread at the lower speeds, barring the :math:`\dot{\phi}` coefficient which has
large spread and no apparent relationship with speed for both equations. The
roll equation also seems to have less spread in the experimental data. For
example, the :math:`a_{\ddot{\phi}\delta}` coefficient appears to be very tight
and the first principles models predict it very well. The constant, linear, and
quadratic trends in the coefficients are somewhat visible in the data but the
variance in the coefficients clouds it. This variability in the coefficient
predictions depend on many thing including data quality, the ability to
identify a process noise model, speed being constant during the run, choice of
unknown coefficients, and more. With all of these improved detailed regression
models may be able to reveal the true trends [#mixedeffects]_. Nonetheless,
these graphs reveal several important things:

- The identified models predict their data well with most having mean predicted
  variance of the four outputs above 70% (but this tightly correlated to run
  duration).
- Some of the coefficients are well predicted by the Whipple model and can be
  fixed from first principles calculations, notably: :math:`a_{\ddot{\phi}\phi}`,
  :math:`a_{\ddot{\phi}\delta}` and :math:`b_{\ddot{\delta}T_\delta}` and maybe
  even :math:`a_{\ddot{\delta}\delta}`.
- The roll rate coefficients are highly variable with poor prediction by the
  models. Deficiencies in the first principles are likely.
- Either the higher speed runs are outliers, or the behavior of the system
  changes more rapidly with speeds above 5 m/s or so.
- Some coefficients spread around zero giving inconsistent sign and others give
  opposite signs as the first principles models expect.

It is a frequency response plot at the mean speed for a set of runs. The blue

Even though the spread in the identified parameters seems high in Figures
:ref:`8 <figACoefficients>` and :ref:`9 <figACoefficients>`, the Bode plot
shows that the identified system response is not as variable, especially in
magnitude. It is also apparent that the experimental magnitude mean has a -5 to
-10 dB offset across the frequency range shown with respect to the Whipple
model, although the Whipple model does fall within one standard deviation of
the mean. This correlates with the amplitude differences in the trajectories
shown in :ref:`Figure 7 <figExampleFit>`. Notice that the arm model has little
to no offset between 2 and 10 rad/s, thus the better amplitude matching. The
frequency response gives a better indication of the overall identified model
quality.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

I have shown that a fourth order structured state space model is both adequate
and good for describing the motion of the bicycle under manual control in a
speed range from approximately 1.5 m/s to 9 m/s. The fact that higher order
models may not be necessary for bicycle dynamic description is an important
finding. More robust models of single track vehicles are typically higher than
4th order, with degrees of freedom associated with tire slip, frame
flexibilities, and rider biomechanics. These findings suggest that the more
complex models may be overkill for many modeling purposes. The data
subsequently also reveals that fourth order archetypal first principles models
are not robust enough to fully describe the dynamics. The deficiencies are most
likely due to un-modeled effects with the knife edge, no side slip wheel
contact assumptions being the most probable candidate. Un-modeled rider
biomechanics such as passive arm stiffness and damping and head motion may play
a role too. The uncertainty in the estimates of the physical parameters,
Chapter :ref:`physicalparameters`, is not large enough to explain the difference
between the coefficient identification and their predictions from first
principles. It is likely that something as simple as a "static" tire scrub
torque is needed to improve the fidelity of the first principles derivations,
but that doesn't preclude that the additional of a tire slip model would also
improve the models.

Canonical Identification
------------------------

One issue I faced with the state space realization was dealing with multiple
experiments. Ideally I had hoped to identify a linear model that was a function
of speed with respect to all or various subsets of the experiments. It is
possible to concatenate runs, but discontinuities in the data potentially throw
off the identification. There is also the possibility of designing a cost
function that gives the error in all the outputs across all of the runs
simultaneously instead of on a per run basis. Both my recently obtained
knowledge in system identification and the constraints of the methods available
in the Matlab System Identification toolbox were limiting factors in these two
approaches. But, Karl Åström suggested doing the system identification with
respect to the second order form of the equations of motion. This would allow
one to use both simple least squares for the solution and the ability to
compute models from large sets of runs. This section deals with this approach.

Model structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The identification of the linear dynamics of the bicycle can be formulated with
respect to the benchmark canonical form realized in [Meijaard2007]_, Equation
:eq:`eqCanonical`. If the time varying quantities in the equations are all
known at each time step, the coefficients of the linear equations can be
estimated given enough time steps.

.. math::
   :label: eqCanonical

   \mathbf{M} \ddot{q} + v \mathbf{C}_1 \dot{q} + [g \mathbf{K}_0 + v^2
   \mathbf{K}_2] q = T

where the time varying states roll and steer are collected in the vector
:math:`q = [\phi \quad \delta]^T` and the time varying inputs roll torque and
steer torque are collected in the vector :math:`T = [T_\phi \quad T_\delta]^T`.
This equation predicts that the velocity is constant with respect to time as
the model was linearized about a constant velocity equilibrium, but the
velocity can also potentially be treated as a time varying parameter if the
acceleration negligible. I extend the equations to properly account for the
lateral perturbation force, :math:`F`, which was the actual input we delivered
during the experiments. It contributes to both the roll torque and steer torque
equations.

.. math::
   :label: eqExtendedCanonical

   \mathbf{M} \ddot{q} + v \mathbf{C}_1 \dot{q} + [g \mathbf{K}_0 + v^2
   \mathbf{K}_2] q = T + H F

where :math:`H = [H_{\phi F} \quad H_{\delta F}]^T` is a vector describing the
linear contribution of the lateral force to the roll and steer torque
equations. :math:`H_{\phi F}` is approximately the distance from the ground to
the force application point. :math:`H_{\delta F}` is a distance that is a
function of the bicycle geometry (trail, wheelbase) and the longitudinal
location of the force application point. For our normal geometry bicycles,
including the one used in the experiments, :math:`H_{\delta F} << H_{\phi F}`.
I estimate :math:`H` for each rider/bicycle from geometrical measurements and
the state space form of the linear equations of motion calculated in Chapter
:ref:`extensions`.

.. math::
   :label: eqStateSpace

   \dot{x} = \mathbf{A} x + \mathbf{B} u

where :math:`x = [\phi \quad \delta \quad \dot{\phi} \quad \dot{\delta}]^T` and
:math:`u = [F \quad T_\phi \quad T_\delta]^T`. The state and input matrices can
be sectioned.

.. math::
   :label: eqStateMatrx

   \mathbf{A} =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & \mathbf{I} \\
     \mathbf{A}_l & \mathbf{A}_r
   \end{bmatrix}

.. math::
   :label: eqInputMatrix

   \mathbf{B} =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & 0\\
     \mathbf{B}_F & \mathbf{B}_T
   \end{bmatrix}

where :math:`\mathbf{A}_l` and :math:`\mathbf{A}_r` are the 2 x 2 sub-matrices
corresponding to the states and their derivatives, respectively.
:math:`\mathbf{B}_F` and :math:`\mathbf{B}_T` are the 2 x 1 and 2 x 2
sub-matrices corresponding to the lateral force and the torques, respectively.
The benchmark canonical form can now be written as

.. math::
   :label: eqCanonInState

   \mathbf{B}_T^{-1} [ \ddot{q} - \mathbf{A}_r \dot{q} - \mathbf{A}_l q] = T +
   \mathbf{B}_T^{-1} \mathbf{B}_F F

where

.. math::
   :label: eqCanonStateRelation

   \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{B}_T^{-1}

   v \mathbf{C}_1 = -\mathbf{B}_T^{-1} \mathbf{A}_r

   [g \mathbf{K}_0 + v^2 \mathbf{K}_2] = -\mathbf{B}_T^{-1} \mathbf{A}_l

   H = \mathbf{B}_T^{-1} \mathbf{B}_F

.. _tabForceLocation:

.. tabularcolumns:: LL

.. list-table:: The location of the lateral force point for each rider.

     - :math:`[0.943 \quad 0.011]^T` m
   * - Luke
     - :math:`[0.902 \quad 0.011]^T` m

The location of the lateral force application point is the same for Charlie and
Luke because they used the same seat height. The force was applied just below
the seat, which was adjustable in height for different riders.

Data processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chapter :ref:`davisbicycle` details how each of the signals were measured and
processed. For the following analysis, all of the signals were filtered with a
second order low pass Butterworth filter at 15 Hz. The roll and steer
accelerations were computed by numerically differentiating the roll and steer
rate signals with a central differencing method except for the end points being
handled by forward and backward differencing. The mean was subtracted from all
the signals except the lateral force.

Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simple analytic identification problem can be formulated from the canonical
form. If we have good measurements of :math:`q`, their first and second
derivatives, forward speed :math:`v`, and the inputs :math:`T_\delta` and
:math:`F`, the entries in :math:`\mathbf{M}`, :math:`\mathbf{C}_1`,
:math:`\mathbf{K}_0`, :math:`\mathbf{K}_2`, and :math:`H` can be identified by
forming two simple regressions, i.e. one for each equation in the canonical
form. I use the instantaneous speed at each time step rather than the mean over
a run to improve accuracy with respect to the speed parameter as it has some
variability.

The roll and steer equation each can be put into a simple linear form

.. math::
   :label: eqAxEB

   \mathbf{\Gamma} \Theta = Y

where :math:`\Theta` is a vector of the unknown coefficients and
:math:`\mathbf{\Gamma}` and :math:`Y` are made up of the inputs and outputs
measured during a run.  :math:`\Theta` can be all or a subset of the entries in
the canonical matrices.  If there are :math:`N` samples in a run and we desire
to find :math:`M` entries in the equation, then :math:`\mathbf{\Gamma}` is an
:math:`N \times M` matrix and :math:`Y` is an :math:`N \times 1` vector. The
Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse can be employed to solve for :math:`\Theta`
analytically. The estimate of the unknown parameters is then

.. math::
   :label: eqThetaEstimate

   \hat{\Theta} = [\mathbf{\Gamma}^T \mathbf{\Gamma}]^{-1} \mathbf{\Gamma}^T Y

For example, if we fix the mass terms in the steer torque equation and let the
rest be free the linear equation is

.. math::
   :label: eqExampleLeastSquares

   \begin{bmatrix}
      v(1) \dot{\phi}(1) & v(1) \dot{\delta}(1) & g \phi(1) & g \delta(1) &
      v(1)^2 \phi(1) & v(1)^2 \delta(1) & - F(1)\\
      \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
      v(N) \dot{\phi}(N) & v(N) \dot{\delta}(N) & g \phi(N) & g \delta(N) &
      v(N)^2 \phi(N) & v(N)^2 \delta(N) & - F(N)\\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
     C_{1\delta\phi}\\
     C_{1\delta\delta}\\
     K_{0\delta\phi}\\
     K_{0\delta\delta}\\
     K_{2\delta\phi}\\
     K_{2\delta\delta}\\
     H_{\delta F}
   \end{bmatrix} \\
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     T_\delta(1) - M_{\delta\phi} \ddot{\phi}(1) -
     M_{\delta\delta} \ddot{\delta}(1)\\
     \vdots\\
     T_\delta(N) - M_{\delta\phi} \ddot{\phi}(N) -
     M_{\delta\delta} \ddot{\delta}(N)
   \end{bmatrix}

The error in the fit is

.. math::
   :label: eqFitError

   \epsilon = \hat{Y} - Y = \mathbf{\Gamma} \hat{\Theta} - Y

The covariance of :math:`\Theta`, Equation :eq:`eqCovariance`, of the parameter
estimations can be computed with respect to the error.

.. math::
   :label: eqVariance

   \sigma^2 = \frac{\epsilon^T\epsilon}{N - d}

.. math::
   :label: eqCovariance

   \mathbf{U} = \sigma^2 (\mathbf{\Gamma}^T \mathbf{\Gamma})^{-1}

Equations :eq:`eqThetaEstimate`, :eq:`eqFitError`, :eq:`eqVariance`, and
:eq:`eqCovariance` can be solved for each run individually, a portion of a run,
or a set of runs. Secondly, all of the parameters in the canonical matrices
need not be estimated. The analytical benchmark bicycle model [Meijaard2007]_
gives a good idea of which entries in the matrices we may be more certain about
from our physical parameters measurements in Chapter :ref:`physicalparameters`.
I went through the benchmark formulation and fixed the parameters based on
these rules:

- If the parameter is greatly affected by trail, leave it free.
- If the parameter is greatly affected by the front assembly moments and
  products of inertia, leave it free.
- If the parameter is equal or near to zero, fix it.

For the roll equation this leaves :math:`M_{\phi\delta}`,
:math:`C_{1\phi\delta}`, and :math:`K_{0\phi\delta}` as free parameters. And
for the steer equation this leaves :math:`M_{\delta\phi}`,
:math:`M_{\delta\delta}`, :math:`C_{1\delta\phi}`, :math:`C_{1\delta\delta}`,
:math:`K_{0\delta\phi}`, :math:`K_{0\delta\delta}`, :math:`K_{2\delta\delta}`,
and :math:`H_{\delta F}` as free parameters.

I start by identifying the three coefficients of the roll equation for the
given data. This choice is due to there being more certainty in the roll
equation estimates from first principles.

.. math::
   :label: eqRollEquation

   \begin{bmatrix}
      \ddot{\delta}(1) &
      v(1) \dot{\delta}(1) &
      g \delta(1) \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
      \ddot{\delta}(N) &
      v(N) \dot{\delta}(N) &
      g \delta(N) \\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
     M_{\phi\delta} \\
     C_{1\phi\delta} \\
     K_{0\phi\delta}
   \end{bmatrix} \\
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     H_{\phi F} F(1)
     - M_{\phi\phi} \ddot{\phi}(1)
     - C_{1\phi\phi} v(1) \dot{\phi}(1)
     - K_{0\phi\phi} g \phi(1)
     - K_{2\phi\phi} v(1)^2 \phi(1)
     - K_{2\phi\delta} v(1)^2 \delta(1) \\
   \vdots\\
     H_{\phi F} F(N)
     - M_{\phi\phi} \ddot{\phi}(N)
     - C_{N\phi\phi} v(N) \dot{\phi}(N)
     - K_{0\phi\phi} g \phi(N)
     - K_{2\phi\phi} v(N)^2 \phi(N)
     - K_{2\phi\delta} v(N)^2 \delta(N) \\
   \end{bmatrix}

I then enforce the assumptions that :math:`M_{\phi\delta} = M_{\delta\phi}`
and :math:`K_{0\phi\delta} = K_{0\delta\phi}` to fix these values in the steer
equation to the ones identified in the roll equation, leaving less free
parameters in the steer equation. This matrix symmetry is likely enforced in
reality due to the simple coupling of the front and rear frames by a revolute
joint [#symmetry]_. Finally, I identify the remaining steer equation
coefficients with

.. math::
   :label: eqSteerEquation

   \begin{bmatrix}
     \ddot{\delta}(1) &
     v(1) \dot{\phi}(1) &
     v(1) \dot{\delta}(1) &
     g \phi(1) &
     v(1)^2 \delta(1) &
     - F(1)\\
     \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
     \ddot{\delta}(N) &
     v(N) \dot{\phi}(N) &
     v(N) \dot{\delta}(N) &

     v(N)^2 \delta(N) &
     - F(N)\\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
     M_{\delta\delta} \\
     C_{1\delta\phi} \\
     C_{1\delta\delta} \\
     K_{0\delta\phi} \\
     K_{2\delta\delta} \\
     H_{\delta F}
   \end{bmatrix} \\
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     T_\delta(1)
     - M_{\delta\phi} \ddot{\phi}(1)
     - K_{0\delta\delta} g \delta(1)
     - K_{2\delta\phi} v(1)^2 \phi(1) \\

   \end{bmatrix}

Results
~~~~~~~

I selected data for three riders on the same bicycle, performing two maneuvers,
in two different environments. I have little reason to believe the dynamics of
the passive system should vary much with respect to different maneuvers, but
there is potentially variation across riders due to the differences in their
inertial properties and there may be variation across environments because of
the differences in the wheel to floor interaction. I opted to compute the best
fit model across series of runs to benefit from the large dataset. This leaves
these four scenarios:

- All riders in both environments, one data set
- All riders in each environment, two data sets
- Each rider in both environments, three data sets
- Each rider in each environment, six data sets

A total of 12 different models can be derived from this perspective.

All riders in both environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section details the example results for one subset of data. Here I make
the assumption that the best fit model doesn't vary much across riders or
environments. The assumption that the passive model of the bicycle and rider
are similar with respect to rider can be justified by recognizing that the
Whipple model predicts little difference in the dynamics with respect to the
three bicycle/rider combinations. On the other hand, I have little reason to
believe the environments are the same except that both floors are made of a
rubber like material. I calculated the best fit over 374 runs giving about 142
minutes of data sampled at 200 Hz, :math:`N=1720647`.

The eigenvalues as a function of speed of the identified model can be compared
to those of the Whipple and arm models. :ref:`Figure 11 <figAARloc>` shows the
root locus of the three models. The weave mode exists in all three models, with
it always being stable in the arm model and it being unstable at lower speeds
in the other two models. The identified model is unstable over most of the
shown speed range. Above 3 m/s or so, the Whipple model's weave mode diverges
from the identified model to different asymptotes. The arm model weave mode
diverges somewhere in between. Note that the arm model has an unstable real
mode for all speeds. :ref:`Figure 12 <figAAEig>` gives a different view of the
root locus allowing one to more easily compare the real eigenvalues. The
imaginary parts of the weave mode have similar curvature with respect to speed
for all the models, with the identified model having about 1 rad/s larger
frequency of oscillation for all speeds. The identified model does have a
stable speed range with the Whipple model under predicting the weave critical
speed by almost 2 m/s. The identified caster mode is much faster than the one
predicted by the Whipple model.

The identification process is structured around identifying the input/output
relationship among measured variables. The frequency response provides a view
into these relationships. Figures :ref:`13 <figAATphiPhi>` to :ref:`14
<figAATphiDel>` give a picture of how the first principles models compare to
the identified model with respect to frequency response from a roll torque
input. The frequency band from 1 rad/s to 12 rad/s is of most concern as it
bounds a reasonable range that the human can operate in. The roll torque to
roll angle response shows that at 2 m/s the response is predicted well at high
frequencies by all the models and that the Whipple model predicts the response
well across all frequencies. At 4 m/s the two models only predict the high
frequency behavior (> 4 rad/s) with the arm model appearing slightly better.

The steer torque to roll angle transfer function, :ref:`Figure 15
<figAATdelPhi>` may be the most important to model accurately as it is the
primary method of controlling the bicycle's direction, i.e. commanding roll
allows one to command yaw. At 2 m/s the Whipple model magnitude matches at
lower frequencies better and the arm model better at higher frequencies. At all
higher speeds the Whipple and arm models don't match well at low frequencies.

Comparison of identified models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tables :ref:`3 <tabIdMCKOne>`, :ref:`4 <tabIdMCKTwo>`, and :ref:`5
<tabIdMCKThree>` present the identified canonical parameters from all twelve of
the chosen data subsets. The variance of the parameter estimates in the steer
equation are quite low except for the :math:`H_{\delta F}` parameter. The low
variance is partially due to the large datasets but also due to the quality of
the resulting fits. The :math:`H_{\delta F}` is highly dependent on the trail
which is expected to be difficult to identify. The roll equations parameters
have higher relative variance, which reflects the fewer degree of freedom the
regression has available for fitting the data. It is also interesting to note
that :math:`C_{1 \delta \phi}` deviates quite largely from the Whipple model
prediction. This term depends on the wheel radii, wheel rotational inertia,
wheelbase, steer axis tilt and trail. All of these but trail are easily
measured so it is tempting to solve for trail given :math:`C_{1 \delta \phi}`
and the other measured parameters described in [Meijaard2007]_.

The results for each data subset are given in :ref:`Table 6
<tabIdentifiedTrail>`. On average the values are very unrealistic when compared
to the measured geometric trail of :math:`c=0.0599` meters. This may imply that
that including the effects of pneumatic trail would not be enough to improve
the predictive capabilities of the Whipple model.

The measurement errors, model structure and order dictate how well the models
can predict the input-output behavior of each run or even each perturbation.
The ideal goal is to select one or a small set of models that do a good job at
predicting the measured behavior for each run. The previous section's state
space methods have already shown that the Whipple and arm models may not
provide adequate predictions.

Figures :ref:`17 <figCompBode2p0>`, :ref:`18 <figCompBode5p5>`, and :ref:`19
<figCompBode9p0>` plot the steer torque to roll angle frequency response for
three speeds: 2 m/s, 5.5 m/s and 9.0 m/s for each of the models in Tables
:ref:`3 <tabIdMCKOne>`, :ref:`4 <tabIdMCKTwo>`, and :ref:`5 <tabIdMCKThree>`.
At the lowest speed, all of the models have a similar frequency response,
especially in the frequency band between about 1 an 20 rad/s. At 5.5 m/s the
models are similar at a higher bandwidth, 4 to 30 rad/s. At 9.0 m/s even higher,
10 to 50 rad/s. Notice that the frequency band where the models are most
similar shifts to higher frequencies at higher speeds.The model derived from
all of the data (all rider and all runs), gives somewhat of a mean model and if
this model is significantly better at predicting the measured behavior of the
Whipple and arm models, it may be a good general candidate model for this
bicycle.

The predictive capability and quality of a given model can be quantified by by
an assortment of criteria and methods. I've made use of two criterion to judge
the quality of these models with respect to given data. The first is to
simulate the system given the measured inputs. This method works well when the
open loop system is stable, but if it is unstable as so in the case of this
bicycle, it may be difficult to simulate. Searching for initial conditions
that give rise to a stable model for the duration of the run or simulating by
weighting the future error less may relieve the instability issues. Another
option is to see how well the inputs are predicted given the measured outputs.
The canonical form of the equations lend themselves to this and only two inputs
per run need be checked.

I designate the predicted torques on the system as

.. math::
   :label: eqPredictedTorques

   y_p = \mathbf{M} \ddot{q} + v \mathbf{C}_1 \dot{q} + [g \mathbf{K}_0 + v^2
   \mathbf{K}_2] q

and the measured torques as

.. math::
   :label: eqMeasuredTorques

   y_m = T + H F

:math:`y_p` and :math:`y_m` can be computed for each run along with the
*variance accounted for* (VAF), by the model for both the total roll torque and
the steer torque

.. math::
   :label: eqVAF

   \textrm{VAF} = 1 - \frac{||y_p - y_m||}{||y_m - \bar{y}_m||}

I compute the VAF for each of the 374 runs used in the canonical identification
outlined in Equation :eq:`eqVAF` using each of the 12 identified models and
both the Whipple and Arm models. This percentage can be used as a criterion of
which to judge the ability of model versus another to predict the measurement.
I then take the median of the VAF over each of the 12 sets of runs, Tables
:ref:`7 <tabMeanVAFRoll>` and :ref:`8 <tabMeanVAFSteer>`. The results give an
idea of how well the various models are able to predict the data for all of the
runs in a given set.

.. _tabMeanVAFRoll:

.. table:: Mean VAF for the steer equation of various models (rows) for all
   runs in each data subset (columns).

   .. include:: tables/systemidentification/median-steer.rst

.. raw:: latex

   }

Tables :ref:`7 <tabMeanVAFRoll>` and :ref:`8 <tabMeanVAFSteer>` give the median
for each set of runs in each column for each model in given in the row for roll
and steer respectively. The maximum VAF in the column gives a measure of the
best model for predicting each individual run in that set of runs. Intuitively,
I would expect that the diagonal of the upper 12 rows would be the maximum in
each column due to the fact that that model was derived from that set of runs,
but that is not always the case. I believe that this can be explained by the
fact that there are more outlier runs in some sets. These outliers have enough
effect in the resulting regressions, that the models generated from sets of
runs with less outliers are able to predict the data better.

The models are able to predict the steer torque much better than the roll
torque. The roll torque should be zero in all of the runs without disturbances
but the roll equations do not predict a zero value. This is also reflected in
the negative median values of all the runs with disturbances in much of
:ref:`Table 7 <tabMeanVAFRoll>`. We fixed six of the nine parameters in the
roll equation to those of the Whipple model and fixed three of the nine
parameters in the steer equation. These extra degrees of freedom can partially
explain why the steer predictions are better than the roll predictions. The
model for the roll torque is more susceptible to the noise in the rate and
angle measurements and has consequences of +/- 50 Nm variation in the predicted
roll torques. These are unfortunately comparable in magnitude to the measured
roll torques due to the lateral perturbations. But :ref:`Table 7
<tabMeanVAFRoll>` can still be used to gage which models are better with
reference to each other. The values in :ref:`Table 7 <tabMeanVAFRoll>` are only
generated from the runs with disturbances as a relative measure of quality to
zero is hard to make.

Tables :ref:`7 <tabMeanVAFRoll>` and :ref:`8 <tabMeanVAFSteer>` reveal:

- The arm model is poor at predicting the steer torque.
- The models derived from Charlie's runs are poorer at predicting the inputs.
- The Whipple model is not too bad at predicting steer torque, but on median
  10% worse than the best models.
- The models identified from the pavilion runs are generally the best (with
  exception of Charlie's). The ones generated from Luke and Jason's runs are
  typically the best at predicting both steer torque and roll torque, with
  Luke's giving better roll torque predictions.
- The roll torque is poorly predicted by all models when it is supposed to be
  zero. This raises implications in the validity of the roll equation and the
  potential need for tire slip models.

It may seem odd that a model identified from the subset of runs of one rider in
one environment is the best at predicting the runs on a individual basis, but
the uncertainty and error in both the data and the model structures don't
dictate that this can't be. Keep in mind that all of the frequency response of
all 12 models shown in Figures :ref:`17 <figCompBode2p0>`, :ref:`18
<figCompBode5p5>`, and :ref:`19 <figCompBode9p0>` are probably bounded in the
uncertainty of the predicted responses and each is can be considered a "good"
model, even including the Whipple model.

The second method of evaluating the quality of the identified models is to
simulate the model with the measured inputs and compare the predicted outputs
with the measured outputs with a similar VAF criteria. I simulated all 14
models with the inputs from the 374 runs and computed the VAF explained by the
model for each output. Since the models are typically unstable at all of the
speeds we tested, I searched for the set of initial conditions which minimizes
the VAF for all outputs. For the majority of runs and models, this is
sufficient to to have a stable simulation for the duration of the run.
However, this is not always the case. For long duration runs I select a random
20 second section of the data to simulate, reducing the likelihood that the
simulation blows up due to the model's instability. Finally, I ignore any
outputs VAFs that are less than -100 percent as they are most likely due to
unstable simulations. :ref:`Table 9 <tabMedianVAFOutputs>` presents the median
percent variance accounted for across all runs for each model and each output.
The best model seems to be the one generated from the data with Luke on the
Pavilion Floor once again, but these results differ from the previous
otherwise.

- For all outputs other than roll angle, the arm model is better than the
  Whipple model.
- The models from Charlie's data fair much better than the input comparisons
  and are better than some of Jason's.
- The model identified from the data with Jason on the Pavilion floor is very
  poor in roll angle prediction as opposed to it being a good choice from the
  input comparison results.
- All of the identified models are better predictors than the first principles
  models.

The mean percent variance across the outputs can be computed and the models

The orange lines in Figures :ref:`8 <figACoefficients>` and :ref:`9
<figBCoefficients>` are that of the L-P model and which allows comparison of
the results of the canonical identification process with those of the state
space identified models. The L-P model seems be better at fitting the data,
especially in the steer acceleration equation, but the large variance in the
state space coefficients is still a problem. This lends more confidence that
that the L-P model is a better model choice than the Whipple and arm model.

Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~

Canonical formulation
   The canonical realization is a good method for identifying a model
   for data from multiple runs. It relies on quality measurements of the
   coordinates, rates, and accelerations. I use numerical differentiation
   of the rates to get the accelerations instead of direct measurements and the
   angles are not perfectly related to the rates through differentiation
   because they were measured from different sensors. The noise in the
   measurements and whether the measurements are accurately the derivatives of
   one another have bearing on the results. It is possible to identify all of
   the entries in the canonical matrices, but it is likely some of those are
   easily predicted from first principles so I fix them to the if that is the case.
   This leaves the roll equation mostly known and the steer equation mostly
   unknown and the results reflect better fits with respect to steer than roll as
   a result. This formulation does not explicitly account for process noise, so
   it may be be susceptible to similar accuracy errors as the state space
   formulation does. The advantage in this method is the ability to use large
   sets of data for the calculations. It is surprising that a model from a
   small subset of the data is better at predicting all of the runs on an
   individual basis.
Input comparison
   The input prediction comparisons do not predict the roll torque well at all.
   It seems that the roll torque equation magnifies the noise in the
   coordinate, rate, and acceleration measurements such that the resulting
   noise in the roll torque is equivalent in magnitude to the roll
   perturbations. But the roll perturbations do seem to clearly be present in
   the predictions. This results in difficultly comparing the quality of the
   resulting models with respect to the roll equation. This also points to the
   potential deficiencies in the Whipple roll torque equation and these large
   magnitude roll torques may also be due to inaccurate modeling of the tire
   dynamics.
Output comparison
   The output comparison (simulations) give more reasonable results because all
   four outputs generally fit well across runs given the measured inputs.  It
   is surprising that the ranking of model prediction ability is different for
   the input comparisons than the output comparisons, but the fact that the
   model identified from Luke's pavilion runs is the best from both
   comparisons, at least gives credence to it further adoption. The first
   principles models are dead last in the ranking and the model identified from
   Jason's pavilion runs is surprisingly poor due to poor roll angle
   prediction.
Whipple model
   The input comparisons show that the Whipple model is relatively reasonable
   at predicting the data but the output comparisons make it out to be much
   poorer. The Whipple model is clearly the worst at explaining the variance in
   the steer angle, roll rate,  and steer rate outputs and is second to worst
   in roll angle. Also contrary to the Whipple model predictions, the weave
   mode of all identified models are unstable until at least 8-9 m/s or so. The
   caster mode is also typically much faster in the identified models. This
   implies that the real system does not benefit from open loop stability at
   all during most normal speed bicycling and that the rider is always
   responsible for stabilizing the vehicle. This may explain why none of the
   riders ever felt comfortable enough to try hands-free riding while strapped
   into the harness.
Arm model
   I had hypothesized that the arm model would better predict the measured
   motion because it more accurately modeled the fact that we allowed the rider
   full use of his arms to control the steering. This was validated with
   respect to the output simulation comparisons. They predict that the arm model
   is much better than the Whipple model for most of the output variables. But
   this is in contrast to the input comparison predictions which were the
   opposite, with the Whipple being much better than the arm model. More work
   is needed to verify which model is better and why the results differ at all.
Rider biomechanics may mot be modeled
   The models identified from Charlie's runs are different than those of Jason
   and Luke. The models from Charlie's runs do not predict the runs very well,
   even including the subset of Charlie's data. I'm not sure if the rider's arm
   stiffness can affect these results or how much the different riders can
   effect this if we are only searching for the passive bicycle-rider model.
   The other potential explanation is that I have too many outliers in
   Charlie's runs. This could have something to do with all of the runs that
   had synchronization issues.
Predicting derivatives
   The roll angle is more poorly predicted than the other variables. The steer
   angle and steer rate are better predicted than the roll angle and roll rate.
   In the output comparisons I enforce that the roll rate is the derivative of
   the roll and the same for the steer variables. The poorer predictions of roll
   angle is probably due to noise and error in the independent measurements of
   these variables. I toyed with complementary filters to try an combine the
   angle and rate measurements in a way that filtered and enforced the
   derivative relationship between the measured variables, but did not have
   much luck improving the results. It may be better to focus on one each of
   the roll and steer variables for minimization purposes. It is well known
   that fitting models with much fewer inputs to outputs is difficult and the
   fewer outputs reduces the number of noise terms to estimate.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

The best candidate model for the measured system is the model identified from
the data subset with rider Luke and the pavilion floor. I find no reason to use
different models for each rider, environment as this model does a better job at
predicting than the other models derived from matching subsets. I will use the
model identified from the set of runs with Luke on the pavilion floor as the
base bicycle model for identifying the controller for all the runs in the
following section of this Chapter. I could use the individual bicycle
identifications for each run, but using a model derived from a set of runs has
the advantage that it will be less affected by the lack of identifying the
process noise explicitly.

Suggestions for improving the results.

- Fit to MISO models instead of MIMO for simplification.
- Fix at lest the :math:`a_{\phi\delta}` coefficient and make the noise
  with respect to the kinematical equations equal to zero giving 11-13 total
  parameters to fit
- Using model reduction techniques to combine many MISO and SISO models for a
  given run.
- Use better initial guess techniques and try global optimizers to get to the
  best solution

Rider Controller Identification
===============================

Now that I have a reasonable estimate of the plant, the rider control system
can be identified. There are many control structures that can and may work to
explain the data. If the feedback and input variables are the same for a set of
control structures they can be mapped to each other and are equivalent. Much of
the difference in control structures such as PID, sequential loop closure, LQR
are the physical interpretations of the gains, delays, and other parameters.
Here, I limit the control structure the one developed in [Hess2012]_ and Chapter
:ref:`control`. With this structure, I will have the ability to compare the
results with the theoretical hypothesis we developed.

Grey Box Models

The block diagram of the control structure described in Chapter :ref:`control`
is shown again in Figures :ref:`20 <figInnerLoopsAgain>` and :ref:`21
<figOuterLoopsAgain>`. The closed loop system can be written in state space
form, which will be used with a state space identification procedure as defined
in Section :ref:`<secStateSpaceID>`. I'll develop forms for pure heading
tracking and lateral deviation tracking.

The combined plant (rider neuromuscular model and bicycle) has states

The sequential loop closure dictates that the commanded output variables are

.. math::

   \psi_c = k_{y_q} ({y_q}_c - y_q)

   \phi_c = k_{\psi} (\psi_c - \psi)

   \dot{\phi}_c = k_{\phi} (\phi_c - \phi)

   \delta_c = k_{\dot{\phi}} (\dot{\phi}_c - \dot{\phi})

and the input to the neuromuscular block as a function of the desired path
is

   U_{nm} = k_{\delta} (\delta_c - \delta)

The input to the neuromuscular block can be written in linear form as

The closed loop state space for lateral deviation tracking can be form by
inserting the controller output :math:`U_{nm}` into the plant dynamics
:math:`(\mathbf{A}_p,\mathbf{B}_p)` to rearrange the plant state space to be a
function of the desired path and the lateral force, :math:`u_l = \left[ F \quad
y_{qc} \right]^T`. The closed loop system :math:`(\mathbf{A}_p,\mathbf{B}_p)`
takes the same form as the plant system with exception to the steer torque
acceleration equation, which is now a function of the controller gains, the
neuromuscular parameters, and the desired path of the front wheel contact point.
The new entries to the system matrices are

The output matrix, :math:`\mathbf{C}_l`, can be constructed to provide any
desired outputs, which I choose a subset of the outputs we measured during the
experiments such as steer angle, roll rate, steer torque, etc.

Given that the bicycle model, :math:`(\mathbf{A}_b,\mathbf{B}_b,\mathbf{C}_b)`,
is known the closed loop analytical state space representation is parameterized
by seven parameters: the five controller gains and the two neuromuscular
parameters. The model is eighth order with two inputs.

.. todo:: I'm not sure if the seven parameters are actually uniquely
   identifiable.

Notice that the controller is unlike a state or output feedback model in the
sense that the gains only appear in a single row in the A and B matrices. This
reflects some of the inherent limitations the human system has for sensing and
actuation. Output feedback systems often have an observer so that full
estimated state feedback can be used. This model assumes that the rider does
not have that ability. They are only able to sense noisy outputs and adjust
their torque compensation within the bandwidth limits of the neuromuscular
system based on five simple gains.

I also make use of a second closed loop model which is essentially the same,
but the outer lateral deviation tracking loop is removed and tracking a
commanded heading is left. This model is seventh order with two inputs.

The numerical values from the model derived from Luke's runs in the pavilion
were used to populate the bicycle state space entries,
:math:`(\mathbf{A}_b,\mathbf{B}_b),\mathbf{C}_b)`, except for the entries in
the heading and lateral deviation acceleration equations which were calculated
with the Whipple model.This has the consequence that those entries are
developed with potentially erroneous geometric values such as trail.

Data
----

Only the runs with lateral disturbances are suitable for identifying the rider
controller. I used the subset of 262 valid disturbance runs for the following
analysis. This subset included runs from all three riders, both environments,
and both the lateral deviation and heading tracking maneuvers. All signals had
their means subtracted except for the lateral force.

Identification
--------------

In the following analyses the Kalman gain matrix is assumed to be equal to
zero and the model takes on an output error form. This was required to bring
the number of parameters to a reasonable size and provide a chance at finding
the optimal solution.

Through trial and error with many different approaches to identification, I
found that the optimal solution was not a trivial problem. The SIMO problem
with full noise estimation has a minimum of 15 parameters. This problem is
fraught with local minima. Even with the assumption of an output error
structure and the reduced parameter space to seven, doesn't escape the
difficulty of finding the true minima. To have a decent chance at finding a
good solution, I opted to identify only the SISO system with the lateral force
as the input and the steering angle as the output. The choice of steer angle as
the sole output is much the same reason as [Lange2011]_, i.e. the steer angle
is a very good quality measurement and along with steer torque reflects the
rider's contribution to the system dynamics as a reaction to the lateral force.

I used the prediction error method [Ljung1999]_ to find the optimal parameters
for each run. A good solution required good initial parameter guesses of which
I used a combination of stable starting guesses from the loop closure technique
described in Chapter :ref:`control` and recursively used random guesses from
previous good and bad solutions as starting points, eventually homing in on the
optimal solutions.

The criteria for a good model was based on the variance accounted for in the
measurement output. The mean VAF for all the identified runs is :math:`62 \pm
12` percent, and considering the large relative human remnant, fits above 30%
are still relatively good. I ensured stability on in the identified models and
no issues associated with unstable simulations corrupting the model quality
criteria were present.

It turned out that the identified parameters for the SISO model not only
predicted the steer angle, but when extra outputs are added it predicts them
well too. The resulting parameters from the SISO model can then be used as
initial guesses for the SIMO formulation to check multiple outputs. The
identification process followed these steps:

1. Process, filter and detrend the data.
2. Construct the SISO (I: :math:`F_B`, O: :math:`\delta`) grey box state space model.
3. Identify the five gains and the neuromuscular frequency for the lateral
   force and steer angle data using a variety of initial parameter guesses.
4. Construct the SIMO grey box state space model.
5. Identify the six parameters as before using the result of the SISO
   identification as the initial parameter guess for the SIMO system.

The results in Figures :ref:`22 <figRiderIdTreadmill>` and :ref:`23
<figRiderIdPavilion>` give typical examples of the model's ability to predict
the measured data in two different runs, one the treadmill and the gymnasium
floor respectively. Notice that the human's remnant is relatively large when
the input is zero, especially in the treadmill run. The model is able to
predict the human's initial control response to the external input and lumps
the remnant into the output error. This response is very repeatable across
riders and runs. The model considers the remnant as output error during the non
perturbed portions of the run. Notice that the steer torque is well predicted
around the perturbation. Previous identifications with the Whipple model
predicted much lower torque magnitudes and much different parameters. Including
the identified bicycle model from Section :ref:`<secCanonicalId>` proved to
give much better control predictions.

Results
-------

I computed the optimal five gains and neuromuscular frequency [#neurodamp]_ for
all 262 runs and recorded the VAF of the steer angle output explained by the
model for each run along with the identified parameters.

The first set of quantities of interest are the identified parameters
themselves. As I've already mentioned in the previous section, identifying the
parameters accurately is a function of the number of free parameters, which
parameters are free, and the quality of the noise model. In my case, our noise
model is an output error structure and may contribute to much more spread in
the identified parameters. :ref:`Figure 24 <figfigControlParVsSpeed>` gives an
idea of how the six identified speeds vary with speed. As shown in Chapter
:ref:`control` the theory predicts that the gains are mostly linear above about
2 m/s and that the neuromuscular frequency is a constant parameter with respect
to the human operator.

.. _figControlParVsSpeed:

.. figure:: figures/systemidentification/par-vs-speed-box-all.*
   :width: 6in
   :align: center
   :target: _images/par-vs-speed-box-all.png

   Each of the five identified parameters as a function of speed. The parameter
   values are grouped into 0.5 m/s speed bins and box plots showing their
   distributions are given for each speed bin. The red line gives the median of
   the speed bin, the box bounds the quartiles, and the whisker is 1.5 times the
   inner quartile range. The width of the boxes are proportional to the square
   of the number of runs in the bin. The green line gives the linear fit to the
   median values which are weighted with respect to the standard deviation of
   each speed bin. The neuromuscular frequency is the best constant that fits
   the data. Generated by
   `src/systemidentification/control_parameters_vs_speed_plots.py`.

:ref:`Figure 24 <figfigControlParVsSpeed>` gives these insights:

- The gains increase with speed with :math:`k_{\phi}` and :math:`k_{y_q}` having
  small slopes.
- The low speed runs have much more spread. This is probably due to the fact
  that the human remnant is relatively large at these speeds and the model
  attempts to fit the noise rather than casting it as output error.
- The ~9 m/s have poorer data quality than other runs due to the treadmill
  interference in the measurement electronics, thus the spread is large.
- The neuromuscular frequency stays relatively constant just below 30 rad/s
  barring the higher variability in the low speed runs.
- The gains may be predicted with simple linear relationships.

Loop Shaping
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The values of the parameters are difficult to directly compare with the ones
found by the loop shaping technique described in Chapter :ref:`control` due to
some of the educated guesses about the rider's internal control choices. But it
is possible to evaluate the same loops' frequency responses in an effort to
understand how the rider chooses the gains.

:ref:`Figure 25 <figAllDeltaDeltac>` shows the frequency response of the closed
the inner most loop a single speed bin. The theory presented in [Hess2012]_ and
Chapter :ref:`control` postulates that the rider chooses a gain such that the
damping ratio of the high frequency neuromuscular around 10 rad/s and about
gives about a 10 db peak (:math:`\zeta=0.15`). :ref:`Figure 25
<figAllDeltaDeltac>` shows that there may be a more heavily damped
neuromuscular peak, but the large variability in the lower frequencies
indicates that the rider's choice is not so constant. This may be explained by
the fact that it is more critical for the roll rate loop to exhibit the
neuromuscular peaking and the differences in the three rider's behavior. I've
previously shown in Chapter :ref:`<control>` that there are not necessarily
unique gains in the first too loops to achieve the correct peaking in the roll
rate loop.

.. _figAllDeltaDeltac:

   lines plot the response of each individual run in the speed bin while the

   lines which indicate the one sigma standard deviation.

:ref:`Figure 26 <figAllPhidotPhidotc>` shows the frequency response of the
closed roll rate loop :math:`\frac{\dot{\phi}}{\dot{\phi}_c}(s)`. As was just
pointed out, the theory that this loop which completes the inner control
loop, must exhibit this typical neuromuscular peaking seen in human-machine
control tasks. The mean magnitude plots indicates that this is the case and
that the riders do choose their steer and roll rate gains such that the inner
loops exhibit the typical response.

   lines plot the response of each individual run in the speed bin while the
   solid black line give the mean gain and phase bounded by the dotted black
   lines which indicate the one sigma standard deviation.

Our theory for the selection of the remaining three gains suggests that the
loops follow the dictates of the crossover model (i.e. 20 db slope around
crossover) and that the crossover frequencies start at 2 and each successive
loop is closed at half the previous crossover frequency such that the roll
angle, heading and lateral deviation loops are closed in that order. Figures
:ref:`27 <figAllPhiEphi>`, :ref:`28 <figAllPsiEpsi>`, and :ref:`29
<figAllYqEyq>` show the empirically derived frequency responses for the
remaining loops.

   grey lines plot the response of each individual run in the speed bin while
   the solid black line give the mean gain and phase bounded by the dotted
   black lines which indicate the one sigma standard deviation.

The median crossover frequencies for this 4 m/s speed bin are :math:`w_{\phi
c}=3.66`, :math:`w_{\psi c}= 0.98`, and :math:`w_{y_q c}=1.06`. This indicates
that the rider is more aggressive than our theory predicts with the higher roll
crossover frequency in the roll angle loop. Also, the riders do not crossover
at half the previous frequency, with the two outer loops crossing over at about
the same frequency indicating that the lateral deviation tracking is more
pertinent to the rider than the theory suggests. This may be partially due to
the narrowness of the treadmill which constitutes 80% of the data.

Our hypothesis is that the crossover frequencies are constant with respect to
speed, so the distribution of the crossover frequencies for all runs should
have a tight distribution regardless of speed. Secondly, we postulated that the
rider crosses the roll angle loop around 2 rad/s. :ref:`Figure 30
<figCrossover>` shows the distribution of the crossover frequencies for each
loop where the median values of the crossover frequencies are :math:`w_{\phi
c}=3.31`, :math:`w_{\psi c}= 1.20`, and :math:`w_{y_q c}=0.98`, all with
somewhat large standard deviations.

   :width: 3in
   :align: center
   :target: _images/crossover-all.png

   Median crossover frequencies in rad/s for the open outer loops for all runs
   at all speeds.

If the medians are any indication of the true crossover frequency the rider is
more aggressive than predicted and the two outer loop crossover frequencies are
much closer in value than predicted. The one-half rule of thumb does seem to
hold for the inner two loops.

Full System Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the loops are all closed the system output response to the two inputs
:math:`F_B` and :math:`y_{qc}` can be examined. Given a commanded input
:math:`y_{qc}`, the tracking performance can be gauged by the closed loop Bode
plot :math:`\frac{y_q}{y_{qc}}(s)` given in :ref:`Figure 31 <figAllYqYqc>`.
Notice that in general, the response is well behaved with a 0 dB magnitude out
to about 10 rad/s, all poles are stable and the phase lag increases gradually
with frequency.

Similarly, the system's response to the lateral disturbance force is favorable
for all the identified models. :ref:`Figure 32 <figAllYqFb>` shows a similar
stable response.

Conclusion
----------

I have shown that a simple rider controller can be identified from the
collected data given that the plant model of the bicycle/rider system is
properly modeled, in my case identified separately from the same data. In
addition these basic conclusion arise:

- The fundamental, remnant-free, control response of the rider under lateral
  perturbations can be described reasonably well by the simple five gain
  sequential loop closure and an eighth order closed loop system. No time
  delays are needed and the continuous formulation is adequate for good
  prediction.
- The identified gains seem to exhibit linear trends with respect to speed as
  predicted by theory and the identified neuromuscular frequency seems to be
  constant with a median around the theoretical prediction of 30 rad/s.
- The identified parameters show resemblance to the patterns in the theoretical
  loop closure techniques. Especially in that the rider selects their gains
  such that the closed roll rate loop exhibits a 10 db peak around 10-11 rad/s
  and that the riders cross over the outer three loops in the predicted order.
- The crossover frequencies of the three outer loops are relatively constant
  with respect to speed and point to a speed independence of system response
  bandwidth selection among riders in this task.
- The parameters do not seem to be uniquely identified if the neuromuscular
  damping ratio is included.

All of these conclusions are based on a preliminary statistical view of the
data. I believe the spread in the results can be tightened up significantly
with further data processing and the use of both simple and more complex
statistical methods. In my view, the data set still has a lot more tell with
further analysis but has also revealed the need for further simplified
experiments. The following are some thoughts on improving the analysis:

Improving the bicycle model.
   To have any hope of identifying a realistic and accurate controller, the
   plant must have a very good representative model. The bicycle is an
   excellent platform for testing the human's control system due to it's low
   speed instability and the fact that non-trivial control is needed to stabilize
   and direct the non-minimum phase system, but the first principles models for
   bicycle/rider biomechanics are not yet adequate enough to describe the
   plant. This is mostly due to poor understanding of the tire to ground
   interaction and the rider's complicated coupling to the bicycle frames in
   which the rider is free to use a multitude of actuations for control.
   But, as has been shown here, system identification can be used to develop a
   realistic plant model for specific bicycles and even small variation in
   riders. A data driven model is currently the best choice until the first
   principles models are able to catch up and may, in fact, be able to provide
   more robust models due to the inherent complexity of describing all of the
   system with first principles.
Estimating the process noise matrix.
   The better one can estimate the process noise in the system, the more
   accurate the parameter predictions will get. In all of my attempts I had
   little success in ever estimating the optimal model when some or all of the
   process noise parameters were free. For the controller portion, the process
   noise is not awfully different in magnitudes than the rider's control
   actions with respect to the disturbance and it is very apparent in the low
   speed runs. This type of noise is much more difficult to properly account
   for. The parameter estimates from the output error structures used in this
   study are susceptible to the model fitting the noise and the control actions
   as opposed to just the control actions. The identifications fortunately were
   able to fit the control actions and not the noise and this is much more
   apparent and true in the treadmill runs. It may be possible to developed
   estimates to the process and measurement noise covariance matrices from the
   undisturbed runs where the human's remnant is the dominant source of
   variability in the outputs.
Fixing the neuromuscular model.
   The results give some indication that the neuromuscular model is an
   appropriate choice. The gain identification could possibly be improved by
   fixing both the neuromuscular frequency and damping ratio, and only
   estimating the gains. In general, the more parameters you can be confident
   about via first principles, the more the identified parameters may
   be able to tell you about the system with higher certainty.
Removing outliers.
   A more systematic approach to the removal of outlier data using criteria
   from the resulting fit variance, parameters, and frequency responses would
   help tighten up the data. The outliers are quite apparent in the data I've
   shown and a detailed look at why they are outliers may allow many of them to
   be removed.
Mixed effects modeling.
   To take into account all the factors and repeated experiments there are
   statistical methods available that can account for these. One such is mixed
   effects or multilevel modeling. I explored the use of these in a preliminary
   fashion but need more time to understand the methods so that I apply them
   correctly. This would provide models based around the many factors in the
   experiments and give stronger comparisons with respect to them, such as
   variation among riders, etc.
First Principles Checks
   There are potentially some simpler checks that can be run with respect to
   the first principles models. For example, the Whipple equations of motion
   can be formulated with with no non-holonomic lateral and longitudinal wheel
   constraints leaving only unknown tire forces. The data I've collected, in
   particular the lateral accelerations and roll, yaw, steer angles and rates,
   can be used to back out the in ground plane forces at the tire contact
   points. If these forces aren't the same as the non-holonomic constraints
   predict, then tire slip must be occurring. This validation and others can be
   performed with the data set I've collected, potentially answering some
   important questions.

If I had unlimited time, I would work on these ideas more thoroughly. I hope to
be able to explore the data in more detail with better methodologies and ideas
in the future, but that may or may not happen. Fortunately the data is
available if others would like to try out different methods, plant models,
bicycle models, etc. and my methods, software, and methodologies are hopefully
detailed enough for reuse.

   speed bins had many more runs than others. This method may be used to
   generate a speed independent model based on all of the runs, but needs more
