System Identification
=====================

* Introduction and review
* Model fitting
* Control parameter estimation
* Effects of rider, environment, speed and manuever to human control
* State space form of control system
* Fitting data
* Estimation and/or calculation of the K matrix
* Identify which parameters can be identified on the given data
* Relationship between speed and gains
* Whipple model versus whipple model with arms

Experimental Design
===================

Environments
------------

* Treadmill
* Gym

Manuevers
---------

* Balance
* Track Line
* Disturbance
* Blind
* Riders

Whipple Model Validity
======================

[Biral2003]_ and [Teerhuis2010]_ do a feed forward sim of their models with the
measured steering torque.
