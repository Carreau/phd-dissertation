Foreword

On rare occasion in life one must halt everything in order to focus on one
monumental task of great importance. Few really comprehend the inordinate
amount of time, effort and sacrifice that goes into a dissertation. This paper
was such an endeavor.

Around the world millions of people ride their bikes daily, yet the secrets
that make the magic of bicycling possible have never been fully understood or
entirely quantified. This work brings us closer to that goal. The melding of
man and machine that allows for transportation and gratification has always
been somewhat of a mystery. This compilation delves into the foundations of
bicycling and investigates why itâ€™s possible.

These principles, when fully understood, will greatly enhance our understanding
and perhaps change the world as we know it... at least the bicycling world.
