        - Even in mitosis for big cell, actin is needed to assemble chromosomes :cite:`Lenart2005`
        - Rapid change in actin structure :cite:`Vasilev2012`, timing is also important (exposition to inomycine disrupt cortex functionality)
        - F-actin network capable of supporting mechanical load :cite:`Feric2013` 
        - Presence of f-Actin mesh work mesh size ~0.5µm :cite:`Feric2013` 
        - This actin network can wistand repetitive compression :cite:`Feric2013` 
        - F actin network might be linked to the lamin (a kind of IF) cortex around the nucleus :cite:`Feric2013` 
        - Such a network would only need to sustain a pressure on the order od 0.01 PA :cite:`Feric2013`,
          and is essential to fight against gravity



Introduction
************

Cells are the basic component of living organism, understanding their
individual behavior and the way they function is a key step into understanding
how they interact with their environment and other organism. One of the key
component to most of organism is Actin, a protein which is highly conserved
across the species and play a important role in cell mechanics, from cell
migration to cell differentiation and division. It plays also a non negligible
in most mechanical properties of the cell and how it interacts with its
environment. In particular actin is the main component of the actin cortex :
the part of the cell cytoskeleton below the plasma membrane mostly responsible
for cell mechanical properties. The properties of this actin cortex is drive by
the mechanics of the properties of its main component : a dynamic actin
network. Understanding this actin network is hence a key piece to learn how
the actin cortex behave. 

The properties of an actin network highly depend on it's structure. The
structure itself depends on many parameters that influence how the network is
formed. Network structure and formation can be not only influence by its
physical and chemical environments but also by the variation of this
parameters with time and space.

Cells are complex systems that adapt their shape, mechanical properties and
biochemical conditions permanently. The spacial repartition of theses
properties is also variable as the cell regulate the concentration of proteins
all across its body. To well study the effect of each components independently,
it is crucial to study actin network in a controlled environment.

Biomimetic systems allow to respond to most of these concern, they provide a
well controlled environment where biochemical condition can be well controlled
both in space and time. Theses systems keep their biological relevance, as they
can mimic *in vivo* phenomenon. Biomimetic systems are also well adapted to the
tools available and the approach from a physics point of view. The optical trap
will allow us to study local mechanical properties of actin  network  with a
high time resolution which could allow to get insight into the variation of
theses properties as a function of time. 


During my PhD, my work has mainly be to study the mechanics of branched actin
network polymerizing on optically trapped polystyrene beads. Such network was
studied before :cite:`Kawska2012`  but have suspected to be highly inhomogeneous,
the use of optical trap allowed to probe mechanics of part of the network
unaccessible before.

    - time resolution
    - network dynamics
    - Move to liposome, 
    - study in OOCyte : 
    - Basically from purely biiomimetic to real cells
