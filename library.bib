 abstract = {Cells are extremely complex because they have to perform a vast number of processes. However, this also makes it difficult for researchers to figure out how the individual parts of the cell work. There is interest, therefore, in developing simple artificial cells that can accurately mimic how specific parts of a cell behave.
An important process for a cell is called polarization. This is where the contents of the cell arrange themselves in a way that is not symmetrical. Polarization is necessary for many cellular functions, and is particularly important during embryonic development where it helps to form the complex shape of the developing embryo.
The cytoskeleton—a dynamic structure that supports the cell and enables it to move—is crucial for polarization. An important part of the cytoskeleton is the actin cortex. This is a thin active sheet made up of a network of tiny filaments of a protein called actin that assembles at the inner face of the cell membrane. Many aspects of the structure and behavior of the actin cortex are not understood.
Abu Shah and Keren have now developed an artificial cell system using aqueous droplets surrounded by oil that can reproduce the behavior of actin cortices in real cells. An actin cortex forms upon the localization of specific nucleation factors at the inner surface of the droplets.
The artificial cortices are capable of spontaneous symmetry breaking, similar to the initial polarization in embryonic cells during development. This symmetry breaking is driven by molecular motors called myosins and depends on the connectivity of the actin network in the cortex. Experiments on the artificial cells also rule out several other mechanisms that have been proposed to explain symmetry breaking.
The work of Abu Shah and Keren represents a further step towards the goal of creating simple artificial cells that can move and divide.

 abstract = {Female meiotic divisions are extremely asymmetric, giving rise to a large oocyte and small degenerating polar bodies, keeping the maternal stores for further embryo development. This asymmetry is achieved via off-center positioning of the division spindle. Mouse oocytes have developed a formin-2-dependent actin-based spindle positioning mechanism that allows the meiotic spindle to migrate towards the closest cortex. Using spinning disk microscopy and FRAP analysis, we studied the changes in the organization of the cytoplasmic F-actin meshwork during the first meiotic division. It is very dense in prophase I, undergoes a significant density drop upon meiosis resumption and reforms progressively later on. This meshwork remodeling correlates with endogenous formin 2 regulation. High formin 2 levels at meiosis I entry induce meshwork maintenance, leading to equal forces being exerted on the chromosomes, preventing spindle migration. Hence, the meshwork density drop at meiosis resumption is germane to the symmetry-breaking event required for successful asymmetric meiotic divisions.},

 abstract = {Neuronal growth is an extremely complex yet reliable process that is directed by a dynamic lamellipodial structure at the tip of every growing neurite, called the growth cone. Lamellipodial edge fluctuations are controlled by the interplay between actin polymerization pushing the edge forward and molecular motor driven retrograde actin flow retracting the actin network. The leading edge switches randomly between extension and retraction processes. We identify switching of “on/off” states in actin polymerization as the main determinant of lamellipodial advancement. Our analysis of motility statistics allows for a prediction of growth direction. This was used in simulations explaining the amazing signal detection capabilities of neuronal growth by the experimentally found biased stochastic processes. Our measurements show that the intensity of stochastic fluctuations depend on changes in the underlying active intracellular processes and we find a power law $\eta$ = a∗x$\alpha$ with exponent $\alpha$ = 2.63 ± 0.12 between noise intensity $\eta$ and growth cone activity x, defined as the sum of protrusion and retraction velocity. Differences in the lamellipodial dynamics between primary neurons and a neuronal cell line further suggests that active processes tune the observed stochastic fluctuations. This hints at a possible role of noise intensity in determining signal detection sensitivity.},

They have been found in a multitude of different cell types and are often called "sensory organelles," since they seem to sense the mechanical and chemical environment of a cell. Once formed, filopodia can exhibit complex behavior, they can grow and retract, push or pull, and transform into distinct structures. They are often found to make first adhesive contact with the extracellular matrix, pathogens or with adjacent cells, and to subsequently exert pulling forces. Much is known about the cytoskeletal players involved in filopodia formation, but only recently have we started to explore the mechanics of filopodia together with the related cytoskeletal dynamics. This review summarizes current advancements in our understanding of the mechanics and dynamics of filopodia, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms behind filopodial force exertion.},

Intriguingly, we show that 14-3-3$\sigma$ expression, which in normal breast is localized to the myoepithelial cells, tracks with malignant phenotype in two models of basal-like breast cancer progression, and in patients, it is associated with basal-like subtype and poor clinical outcome. We characterized a mechanism by which 14-3-3$\sigma$ guides breast tumor invasion by integrating cytoskeletal dynamics: it stabilizes a complex of solubilized actin and intermediate filaments to maintain a pool of "bioavailable" complexes for polarized assembly during migration. We show that formation of the actin/cytokeratin/14-3-3$\sigma$ complex and cellular migration are regulated by PKC$\zeta$-dependent phosphorylation, a finding that could form the basis for intervention in aggressive breast carcinomas expressing 14-3-3$\sigma$. Our data suggest that the biology of this protein is important in cellular movement and is contingent on breast cancer subtype.},

@article{Cameron2001,
 abstract = {Polymerization of actin filaments is necessary for both protrusion of the leading edge of crawling cells and propulsion of certain intracellular pathogens, and it is sufficient for generating force for bacterial motility in vitro. Motile intracellular pathogens are associated with actin-rich comet tails containing many of the same molecular components present in lamellipodia, and this suggests that these two systems use a similar mechanism for motility. However, available structural evidence suggests that the organization of comet tails differs from that of lamellipodia. Actin filaments in lamellipodia form branched arrays, which are thought to arise by dendritic nucleation mediated by the Arp2/3 complex. In contrast, comet tails have been variously described as consisting of short, randomly oriented filaments, with a higher degree of alignment at the periphery, or as containing long, straight axial filaments with a small number of oblique filaments. Because the assembly of pathogen-associated comet tails has been used as a model system for lamellipodial protrusion, it is important to resolve this apparent discrepancy. Here, using a platinum replica approach, we show that actin filament arrays in comet tails in fact have a dendritic organization with the Arp2/3 complex localizing to Y-junctions as in lamellipodia. Thus, comet tails and lamellipodia appear to share a common dendritic nucleation mechanism for protrusive motility. However, comet tails differ from lamellipodia in that their actin filaments are usually twisted and appear to be under significant torsional stress.},

@article{Carlier1997,
 abstract = {Actin-binding proteins of the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family are thought to control actin-based motile processes. ADF1 from Arabidopsis thaliana appears to be a good model that is functionally similar to other members of the family. The function of ADF in actin dynamics has been examined using a combination of physical-chemical methods and actin-based motility assays, under physiological ionic conditions and at pH 7.8. ADF binds the ADP-bound forms of G- or F-actin with an affinity two orders of magnitude higher than the ATP- or ADP-Pi-bound forms. A major property of ADF is its ability to enhance the in vitro turnover rate (treadmilling) of actin filaments to a value comparable to that observed in vivo in motile lamellipodia. ADF increases the rate of propulsion of Listeria monocytogenes in highly diluted, ADF-limited platelet extracts and shortens the actin tails. These effects are mediated by the participation of ADF in actin filament assembly, which results in a change in the kinetic parameters at the two ends of the actin filament. The kinetic effects of ADF are end specific and cannot be accounted for by filament severing. The main functionally relevant effect is a 25-fold increase in the rate of actin dissociation from the pointed ends, while the rate of dissociation from the barbed ends is unchanged. This large increase in the rate-limiting step of the monomer-polymer cycle at steady state is responsible for the increase in the rate of actin-based motile processes. In conclusion, the function of ADF is not to sequester G-actin. ADF uses ATP hydrolysis in actin assembly to enhance filament dynamics.},

 abstract = {At mitosis onset, cortical tension increases and cells round up, ensuring correct spindle morphogenesis and orientation. Thus, cortical tension sets up the geometric requirements of cell division. On the contrary, cortical tension decreases during meiotic divisions in mouse oocytes, a puzzling observation because oocytes are round cells, stable in shape, that actively position their spindles. We investigated the pathway leading to reduction in cortical tension and its significance for spindle positioning. We document a previously uncharacterized Arp2/3-dependent thickening of the cortical F-actin essential for first meiotic spindle migration to the cortex. Using micropipette aspiration, we show that cortical tension decreases during meiosis I, resulting from myosin-II exclusion from the cortex, and that cortical F-actin thickening promotes cortical plasticity. These events soften and relax the cortex. They are triggered by the Mos-MAPK pathway and coordinated temporally. Artificial cortex stiffening and theoretical modelling demonstrate that a soft cortex is essential for meiotic spindle positioning.},

 abstract = {Contractile actin cortex is involved in cell morphogenesis, movement, and cytokinesis, but its organization and assembly are poorly understood. During blebbing, the membrane detaches from the cortex and inflates. As expansion ceases, contractile cortex reassembles under the membrane and drives bleb retraction. This cycle enabled us to measure the temporal sequence of protein recruitment to the membrane during cortex reassembly and to explore dependency relationships. Expanding blebs were devoid of actin, but proteins of the erythrocytic submembranous cytoskeleton were present. When expansion ceased, ezrin was recruited to the membrane first, followed by actin, actin-bundling proteins, and, finally, contractile proteins. Complete assembly of the contractile cortex, which was organized into a cagelike mesh of filaments, took ∼30 s. Cytochalasin D blocked recruitment of actin and $\alpha$-actinin, but had no effect on membrane association of ankyrin B and ezrin. Ezrin played no role in actin nucleation, but was essential for tethering the membrane to the cortex. The Rho pathway was important for cortex assembly in blebs.},

Organized networks of semiflexible actin filaments determine cell stiffness and transmit force during mechanotransduction, cytokinesis, cell motility and other cellular shape changes. Although numerous actin-binding proteins have been identified that organize networks, the mechanical properties of actin networks with physiological architectures and concentrations have been difficult to measure quantitatively. Studies of mechanical properties in vitro have found that crosslinked networks of actin filaments formed in solution exhibit stress stiffening arising from the entropic elasticity of individual filaments or crosslinkers resisting extension. Here we report reversible stress-softening behaviour in actin networks reconstituted in vitro that suggests a critical role for filaments resisting compression. Using a modified atomic force microscope to probe dendritic actin networks (like those formed in the lamellipodia of motile cells), we observe stress stiffening followed by a regime of reversible stress softening at higher loads. This softening behaviour can be explained by elastic buckling of individual filaments under compression that avoids catastrophic fracture of the network. The observation of both stress stiffening and softening suggests a complex interplay between entropic and enthalpic elasticity in determining the mechanical properties of actin networks.},

@article{Coburn2013,
 abstract = {For cells the passage from life to death can involve a regulated, programmed transition. In contrast to cell death, the mechanisms of systemic collapse underlying organismal death remain poorly understood. Here we present evidence of a cascade of cell death involving the calpain-cathepsin necrosis pathway that can drive organismal death in Caenorhabditis elegans. We report that organismal death is accompanied by a burst of intense blue fluorescence, generated within intestinal cells by the necrotic cell death pathway. Such death fluorescence marks an anterior to posterior wave of intestinal cell death that is accompanied by cytosolic acidosis. This wave is propagated via the innexin INX-16, likely by calcium influx. Notably, inhibition of systemic necrosis can delay stress-induced death. We also identify the source of the blue fluorescence, initially present in intestinal lysosome-related organelles (gut granules), as anthranilic acid glucosyl esters--not, as previously surmised, the damage product lipofuscin. Anthranilic acid is derived from tryptophan by action of the kynurenine pathway. These findings reveal a central mechanism of organismal death in C. elegans that is related to necrotic propagation in mammals--e.g., in excitotoxicity and ischemia-induced neurodegeneration. Endogenous anthranilate fluorescence renders visible the spatio-temporal dynamics of C. elegans organismal death.},

 abstract = {Normal tissue cells are generally not viable when suspended in a fluid and are therefore said to be anchorage dependent. Such cells must adhere to a solid, but a solid can be as rigid as glass or softer than a baby's skin. The behavior of some cells on soft materials is characteristic of important phenotypes; for example, cell growth on soft agar gels is used to identify cancer cells. However, an understanding of how tissue cells-including fibroblasts, myocytes, neurons, and other cell types-sense matrix stiffness is just emerging with quantitative studies of cells adhering to gels (or to other cells) with which elasticity can be tuned to approximate that of tissues. Key roles in molecular pathways are played by adhesion complexes and the actinmyosin cytoskeleton, whose contractile forces are transmitted through transcellular structures. The feedback of local matrix stiffness on cell state likely has important implications for development, differentiation, disease, and regeneration.},

@article{DosRemedios2003,
 abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton is a complex structure that performs a wide range of cellular functions. In 2001, significant advances were made to our understanding of the structure and function of actin monomers. Many of these are likely to help us understand and distinguish between the structural models of actin microfilaments. In particular, 1) the structure of actin was resolved from crystals in the absence of cocrystallized actin binding proteins (ABPs), 2) the prokaryotic ancestral gene of actin was crystallized and its function as a bacterial cytoskeleton was revealed, and 3) the structure of the Arp2/3 complex was described for the first time. In this review we selected several ABPs (ADF/cofilin, profilin, gelsolin, thymosin beta4, DNase I, CapZ, tropomodulin, and Arp2/3) that regulate actin-driven assembly, i.e., movement that is independent of motor proteins. They were chosen because 1) they represent a family of related proteins, 2) they are widely distributed in nature, 3) an atomic structure (or at least a plausible model) is available for each of them, and 4) each is expressed in significant quantities in cells. These ABPs perform the following cellular functions: 1) they maintain the population of unassembled but assembly-ready actin monomers (profilin), 2) they regulate the state of polymerization of filaments (ADF/cofilin, profilin), 3) they bind to and block the growing ends of actin filaments (gelsolin), 4) they nucleate actin assembly (gelsolin, Arp2/3, cofilin), 5) they sever actin filaments (gelsolin, ADF/cofilin), 6) they bind to the sides of actin filaments (gelsolin, Arp2/3), and 7) they cross-link actin filaments (Arp2/3). Some of these ABPs are essential, whereas others may form regulatory ternary complexes. Some play crucial roles in human disorders, and for all of them, there are good reasons why investigations into their structures and functions should continue.},

While microtubules have been known for a long time to be key players in nuclear positioning, the actin and cytoplasmic intermediate filament cytoskeletons have been implicated in this function more recently and various molecular links between the nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic elements have been identified. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of nuclear localization in various animal cells and give an overview of the evidence suggesting a crucial role of nuclear positioning in cell polarity and physiology and the consequences of nuclear mispositioning in human pathologies.},

 abstract = {Microenvironments appear important in stem cell lineage specification but can be difficult to adequately characterize or control with soft tissues. Naive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are shown here to specify lineage and commit to phenotypes with extreme sensitivity to tissue-level elasticity. Soft matrices that mimic brain are neurogenic, stiffer matrices that mimic muscle are myogenic, and comparatively rigid matrices that mimic collagenous bone prove osteogenic. During the initial week in culture, reprogramming of these lineages is possible with addition of soluble induction factors, but after several weeks in culture, the cells commit to the lineage specified by matrix elasticity, consistent with the elasticity-insensitive commitment of differentiated cell types. Inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II blocks all elasticity-directed lineage specification-without strongly perturbing many other aspects of cell function and shape. The results have significant implications for understanding physical effects of the in vivo microenvironment and also for therapeutic uses of stem cells.},

@article{Feric2013,
 abstract = {The size of a typical eukaryotic cell is of the order of ∼10µm. However, some cell types grow to very large sizes, including oocytes (immature eggs) of organisms from humans to starfish. For example, oocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis grow to a diameter ≥1mm. They have a correspondingly large nucleus (germinal vesicle) of ∼450µm in diameter, which is similar to smaller somatic nuclei, but contains a significantly higher concentration of actin. The form and structure of this nuclear actin remain controversial, and its potential mechanical role within these large nuclei is unknown. Here, we use a microrheology and quantitative imaging approach to show that germinal vesicles contain an elastic F-actin scaffold that mechanically stabilizes these large nuclei against gravitational forces, which are usually considered negligible within cells. We find that on actin disruption, ribonucleoprotein droplets, including nucleoli and histone locus bodies, undergo gravitational sedimentation and fusion. We develop a model that reveals how gravity becomes an increasingly potent force as cells and their nuclei grow larger than ∼10µm, explaining the requirement for a stabilizing nuclear F-actin scaffold in large Xenopus oocytes. All life forms are subject to gravity, and our results may have broad implications for cell growth and size control.},

@article{Guild1997,
 abstract = {At a late stage in Drosophila oogenesis, nurse cells rapidly expel their cytoplasm into the oocyte via intracellular bridges by a process called nurse cell dumping. Before dumping, numerous cables composed of actin filaments appear in the cytoplasm and extend inward from the plasma membrane toward the nucleus. This actin cage prevents the nucleus, which becomes highly lobed, from physically blocking the intracellular bridges during dumping. Each cable is composed of a linear series of modules composed of approximately 25 cross-linked actin filaments. Adjacent modules overlap in the cable like the units of an extension ladder. During cable formation, individual modules are nucleated from the cell surface as microvilli, released, and then cross-linked to an adjacent forming module. The filaments in all the modules in a cable are unidirectionally polarized. During dumping as the volume of the cytoplasm decreases, the nucleus to plasma membrane distance decreases, compressing the actin cables that shorten as adjacent modules slide passively past one another just as the elements of an extension ladder slide past one another for storage. In Drosophila, the modular construction of actin cytoskeletons seems to be a generalized strategy. The behavior of modular actin cytoskeletons has implications for other actin-based cytoskeletal systems, e.g., those involved in Listeria movement, in cell spreading, and in retrograde flow in growth cones and fibroblasts.},

The complete taxonomy of MyoV's load-dependent stepping pathways, and the extent to which these are constrained by motor structure and mechanochemistry, are not understood. Using a polymer model, we develop an analytical theory to describe the minimal physical properties that govern motor dynamics. We solve the first-passage problem of the head reaching the target-binding site, investigating the competing effects of backward load, strain in the leading head biasing the diffusion in the direction of the target, and the possibility of preferential binding to the forward site due to the recovery stroke. The theory reproduces a variety of experimental data, including the power stroke and slow diffusive search regimes in the mean trajectory of the detached head, and the force dependence of the forward-to-backward step ratio, run length, and velocity. We derive a stall force formula, determined by lever arm compliance and chemical cycle rates. By exploring the MyoV design space, we predict that it is a robust motor whose dynamical behavior is not compromised by reasonable perturbations to the reaction cycle and changes in the architecture of the lever arm.},

 abstract = {Actin networks drive many essential cellular processes, including cell migration, cytokinesis and tissue morphogenesis. However, how cells organize and regulate dynamic actin networks that consist of long, unbranched actin filaments is only poorly understood. This study in mouse oocytes reveals that cells can use vesicles as adaptable, motorized network nodes to regulate the dynamics and density of intracellular actin networks. In particular, Rab11a-positive vesicles drive the network dynamics in a myosin-Vb-dependent manner, and modulate the network density by sequestering and clustering the network's actin nucleators. We also report a simple way by which networks of different densities can be generated, namely by adjusting the number and volume of vesicles in the cell. This vesicle-based mechanism of actin network modulation is essential for asymmetric positioning of the meiotic spindle in mouse oocytes, a vital step in the development of a fertilizable egg in mammals.},

In Drosophila nurse cells, nuclear positioning is crucial during dumping, when nurse cells contract and expel their contents into the oocyte. We provide evidence that in nurse cells, continuous filopodia-like actin cables, growing from the plasma membrane and extending to the nucleus, achieve nuclear positioning. These actin cables move nuclei away from ring canals. When nurse cells contract, actin cables associate laterally with the nuclei, in some cases inducing nuclear turning so that actin cables become partially wound around the nuclei. Our data suggest that a perinuclear actin meshwork connects actin cables to nuclei via actin-crosslinking proteins such as the filamin Cheerio. We provide a revised model for how actin structures position nuclei in nurse cells, employing evolutionary conserved machinery.},

 abstract = {ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) 6 anchors to the plasma membrane, where it coordinates membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton remodelling, but how it assembles actin filaments is unknown. By reconstituting membrane-associated actin assembly mediated by the WASP family veroprolin homolog (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), we recapitulated an Arf6-driven actin polymerization pathway. We show that Arf6 is divergent from other Arf members, as it was incapable of directly recruiting WRC. We demonstrate that Arf6 triggers actin assembly at the membrane indirectly by recruiting the Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) ARNO that activates Arf1 to enable WRC-dependent actin assembly. The pathogen Salmonella usurped Arf6 for host cell invasion by recruiting its canonical GEFs EFA6 and BRAG2. Arf6 and its GEFs facilitated membrane ruffling and pathogen invasion via ARNO, and triggered actin assembly by generating an Arf1-WRC signaling hub at the membrane in vitro and in cells. This study reconstitutes Arf6-dependent actin assembly to reveal a mechanism by which related Arf GTPases orchestrate distinct steps in the WRC cytoskeleton remodelling pathway.},

Close to the trap center, this field is typically approximated as linear in the displacement of the trapped microsphere. However, applications demanding high forces at low laser intensities can probe the light-microsphere interaction beyond the linear regime. Here, we measured the full nonlinear force and displacement response of an optical trap in two dimensions using a dual-beam optical trap setup with back-focal-plane photodetection. We observed a substantial stiffening of the trap beyond the linear regime that depends on microsphere size, in agreement with Mie theory calculations. Surprisingly, we found that the linear detection range for forces exceeds the one for displacement by far. Our approach allows for a complete calibration of an optical trap.},

We used cryo-electron tomography to visualize the 3D structure of the comet tails in situ at the level of individual filaments. We have performed a quantitative analysis of their supramolecular architecture revealing the existence of bundles of nearly parallel hexagonally packed filaments with spacings of 12-13 nm. Similar configurations were observed in stress fibers and filopodia, suggesting that nanoscopic bundles are a generic feature of actin filament assemblies involved in motility; presumably, they provide the necessary stiffness. We propose a mechanism for the initiation of comet tail assembly and two scenarios that occur either independently or in concert for the ensuing actin-based motility, both emphasizing the role of filament bundling.},

In our experimental setup, dynamic actin networks or "gels" are grown on a hard bead in a controlled minimal protein system containing actin monomers, profilin, the Arp2/3 complex and capping protein. We vary protein concentrations and follow experimentally and through simulations the shape and mechanical properties of the actin gel growing around beads. Actin gel morphology is controlled by elementary steps including "primer" contact, growth of the network, entanglement, mechanical interaction and force production. We show that varying the biochemical orchestration of these steps can lead to the loss of network cohesion and the lack of effective force production. We propose a predictive phase diagram of actin gel fate as a function of protein concentrations. This work unveils how, in growing actin networks, a tight biochemical and physical coupling smoothens initial primer-caused heterogeneities and governs force buildup and cell motility.},

Both force production and transmission are self-organizing phenomena whose adaptive features are essential during tissue morphogenesis.

Here we investigate chromosome congression during the first meiotic division in starfish oocytes. We show that microtubules are not sufficient for capturing chromosomes. Instead, chromosome congression requires actin polymerization. After nuclear envelope breakdown, we observe the formation of a filamentous actin mesh in the nuclear region, and find that contraction of this network delivers chromosomes to the microtubule spindle. We show that this mechanism is essential for preventing chromosome loss and aneuploidy of the egg--a leading cause of pregnancy loss and birth defects in humans.},

 abstract = {Nuclear position is actively controlled and can be adjusted according to the needs of a cell by nuclear movement. Microtubules mediate the majority of nuclear movements studied to date, although examples of nuclear movements mediated by the actin cytoskeleton have been described. One such actin-dependent nuclear movement occurs during centrosome orientation in fibroblasts polarizing for migration. Here, the centrosome is maintained at the cell center while the nucleus is moved to the cell rear by actin retrograde flow thus positioning the centrosome between the nucleus and the leading edge of the cell. We have explored the molecular mechanism for actin dependent movement of the nucleus during centrosome centration. We found that a novel linear array of nuclear envelope membrane proteins composed of nesprin-2G and SUN2, called transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines, couple the nucleus to moving actin cables resulting in the nucleus being positioned toward the cell rear. TAN lines are anchored by A-type lamins and this allows the forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton to be transmitted across the nuclear envelope to move the nucleus. Here we review the data supporting this mechanism for nuclear movement, discuss questions remaining to be addressed and consider how this new mechanism of nuclear movement may shed light on human disease.},

WASp and Scar are two similar proteins that bind the p21 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, but their effect on the nucleation activity of the complex was not known. We report that full-length, recombinant human Scar protein, as well as N-terminally truncated Scar proteins, enhance nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex. By themselves, these proteins either have no effect or inhibit actin polymerization. The actin monomer-binding W domain and the p21-binding A domain from the C terminus of Scar are both required to activate Arp2/3 complex. A proline-rich domain in the middle of Scar enhances the activity of the W and A domains. Preincubating Scar and Arp2/3 complex with actin filaments overcomes the initial lag in polymerization, suggesting that efficient nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex requires assembly on the side of a preexisting filament--a dendritic nucleation mechanism. The Arp2/3 complex with full-length Scar, Scar containing P, W, and A domains, or Scar containing W and A domains overcomes inhibition of nucleation by the actin monomer-binding protein profilin, giving active nucleation over a low background of spontaneous nucleation. These results show that Scar and, likely, related proteins, such as the Cdc42 targets WASp and N-WASp, are endogenous activators of actin polymerization by the Arp2/3 complex.},

 abstract = {The actin regulatory protein, cofilin, increases the bending and twisting elasticity of actin filaments and severs them. It has been proposed that filaments partially decorated with cofilin accumulate stress from thermally driven shape fluctuations at bare (stiff) and decorated (compliant) boundaries, thereby promoting severing. This mechanics-based severing model predicts that changes in actin filament compliance due to cofilin binding affect severing activity. Here, we test this prediction by evaluating how the severing activities of vertebrate and yeast cofilactin scale with the flexural rigidities determined from analysis of shape fluctuations. Yeast actin filaments are more compliant in bending than vertebrate actin filaments. Severing activities of cofilactin isoforms correlate with changes in filament flexibility. Vertebrate cofilin binds but does not increase the yeast actin filament flexibility, and does not sever them. Imaging of filament thermal fluctuations reveals that severing events are associated with local bending and fragmentation when deformations attain a critical angle. The critical severing angle at boundaries between bare and cofilin-decorated segments is smaller than in bare or fully decorated filaments. These measurements support a cofilin-severing mechanism in which mechanical asymmetry promotes local stress accumulation and fragmentation at boundaries of bare and cofilin-decorated segments, analogous to failure of some nonprotein materials. ?? 2011 Biophysical Society.},

The membrane skeleton (MSK) primarily consists of actin filaments and associated proteins. The MSK covers the entire cytoplasmic surface and is closely linked to clathrin-coated pits and caveolae. The actin filaments that are closely apposed to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (within 10.2 nm) are likely to form the boundaries of the membrane compartments responsible for the temporary confinement of membrane molecules, thus partitioning the plasma membrane with regard to their lateral diffusion. The distribution of the MSK mesh size as determined by electron tomography and that of the compartment size as determined from high speed single-particle tracking of phospholipid diffusion agree well in both cell types, supporting the MSK fence and MSK-anchored protein picket models.},

 abstract = {The viscoelastic behavior of entangled solutions of semiflexible chains is discussed. After identifying the different possible regimes of concentration and chain length in such a solution, attention is focused on a tightly-entangled regime in which the polymer is confined to a tube of diameter less than its persistence length. A tube model analogous to the DoiEdwards model is introduced to describe this regime. A general expression for the stress tensor of a solution of wormlike chains is derived, which may be applied to any concentration regime, and three intramolecular stress contributions are identified: a curvature contribution arising from forces that oppose transverse deformation or rotation of chain segments, a tension contribution arising from tangential forces that resist stretching or compression of the chain, and an orientational contribution that reduces in the appropriate limit to the Brownian stress of a rigid-rod solution. Intermolecular stress contributions are also calculated. A qualitative discussion is given of the high-frequency viscoelastic response of any solution of wormlike chains, which is dominated by the tension contribution and exhibits a characteristic power law dependence on frequency.},

@article{Mukherjee2013,
 abstract = {Understanding the basis for the action of myosin motors and related molecular machines requires a quantitative energy-based description of the overall functional cycle. Previous theoretical attempts to do so have provided interesting insights on parts of the cycle but could not generate a structure-based free energy landscape for the complete cycle of myosin. In particular, a nonphenomenological structure/energy-based understanding of the unidirectional motion is still missing. Here we use a coarse-grained model of myosin V and generate a structure-based free energy surface of the largest conformational change, namely the transition from the post- to prepowerstroke movement. We also couple the observed energetics of ligand binding/hydrolysis and product release to that of the conformational surface and reproduce the energetics of the complete mechanochemical cycle. It is found that the release in electrostatic free energy upon changing the conformation of the lever arm and the convertor domain from its post- to prepowerstroke state provides the necessary energy to bias the system towards the unidirectional movement of myosin V on the actin filament. The free energy change of 11 kcal is also in the range of ∼2-3 pN, which is consistent with the experimentally observed stalling force required to stop the motor completely on its track. The conformational-chemical coupling generating a successful powerstroke cycle is believed to be conserved among most members of the myosin family, thus highlighting the importance of the previously unknown role of electrostatics free energy in guiding the functional cycle in other actin-based myosin motors.},

@article{Murrell2012,
 abstract = {Here we develop a minimal model of the cell actomyosin cortex by forming a quasi-2D cross-linked filamentous actin (F-actin) network adhered to a model cell membrane and contracted by myosin thick filaments. Myosin motors generate both compressive and tensile stresses on F-actin and consequently induce large bending fluctuations, which reduces their effective persistence length to <1 $\mu$m. Over a large range of conditions, we show the extent of network contraction corresponds exactly to the extent of individual F-actin shortening via buckling. This demonstrates an essential role of buckling in breaking the symmetry between tensile and compressive stresses to facilitate mesoscale network contraction of up to 80\% strain. Portions of buckled F-actin with a radius of curvature \~{}300 nm are prone to severing and thus compressive stresses mechanically coordinate contractility with F-actin severing, the initial step of F-actin turnover. Finally, the F-actin curvature acquired by myosin-induced stresses can be further constrained by adhesion of the network to a membrane, accelerating filament severing but inhibiting the long-range transmission of the stresses necessary for network contractility. Thus, the extent of membrane adhesion can regulate the coupling between network contraction and F-actin severing. These data demonstrate the essential role of the nonlinear response of F-actin to compressive stresses in potentiating both myosin-mediated contractility and filament severing. This may serve as a general mechanism to mechanically coordinate contractility and cortical dynamics across diverse actomyosin assemblies in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells.},

 abstract = {Directional polymerization of actin filaments in branched networks is one of the most powerful force-generating systems in eukaryotic cells. Growth of densely cross-linked actin networks drives cell crawling, intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles, and movement of intracellular pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. Using a modified atomic force microscope (AFM), we obtained force-velocity (Fv) measurements of growing actin networks in vitro until network elongation ceased at the stall force. We found that the growth velocity of a branched actin network against increasing forces is load-independent over a wide range of forces before a convex decline to stall. Surprisingly, when force was decreased on a growing network, the velocity increased to a value greater than the previous velocity, such that two or more stable growth velocities can exist at a single load. These results demonstrate that a single Fv relationship does not capture the complete behaviour of this system, unlike other molecular motors in cells, because the growth velocity depends on loading history rather than solely on the instantaneous load.},

 abstract = {Myosin II propelled actin filaments move ten times faster than kinesin driven microtubules and are thus attractive candidates as cargo-transporting shuttles in motor driven lab-on-a-chip devices. In addition, actomyosin-based transportation of nanoparticles is useful in various fundamental studies. However, it is poorly understood how actomyosin function is affected by different number of nanoscale cargoes, by cargo size, and by the mode of cargo-attachment to the actin filament. This is studied here using biotin/fluorophores, streptavidin, streptavidin-coated quantum dots, and liposomes as model cargoes attached to monomers along the actin filaments ("side-attached") or to the trailing filament end via the plus end capping protein CapZ. Long-distance transportation (>100 µm) could be seen for all cargoes independently of attachment mode but the fraction of motile filaments decreased with increasing number of side-attached cargoes, a reduction that occurred within a range of 10-50 streptavidin molecules, 1-10 quantum dots or with just 1 liposome. However, as observed by monitoring these motile filaments with the attached cargo, the velocity was little affected. This also applied for end-attached cargoes where the attachment was mediated by CapZ. The results with side-attached cargoes argue against certain models for chemomechanical energy transduction in actomyosin and give important insights of relevance for effective exploitation of actomyosin-based cargo-transportation in molecular diagnostics and other nanotechnological applications. The attachment of quantum dots via CapZ, without appreciable modulation of actomyosin function, is useful in fundamental studies as exemplified here by tracking with nanometer accuracy.},

 abstract = {I measured the rate of elongation at the barbed and pointed ends of actin filaments by electron microscopy with Limulus sperm acrosomal processes as nuclei. With improvements in the mechanics of the assay, it was possible to measure growth rates from 0.05 to 280 s-1. At 22 degrees C in 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM imidazole (pH 7), 0.2 mM ATP with 1 mM EGTA or 50 microM CaCl2 or with EGTA and 50 mM KCl, the elongation rates at both ends have a linear dependence on the ATP-actin concentration from the critical concentration to 20 microM. Consequently, over a wide range of subunit addition rates, the rate constants for association and dissociation of ATP-actin are constant. This shows that the nucleotide composition at or near the end of the growing filament is either the same over this range of growth rates or has no detectable effect on the rate constants. Under conditions where polymerization is fastest (MgCl2 + KCl + EGTA) the rate constants have these values: (table; see text) Compared with ATP-actin, ADP-actin associates slower at both ends, dissociates faster from the barbed end, but dissociates slower from the pointed end. Taking into account the events at both ends, these constants and a simple Oosawa-type model account for the complex three-phase dependence of the rate of polymerization in bulk samples on the concentration of ATP-actin monomers observed by Carlier, M.-F., D. Pantaloni, and E. D. Korn (1985, J. Biol. Chem., 260:6565-6571). These constants can also be used to predict the reactions at steady state in ATP. There will be slow subunit flux from the barbed end to the pointed end. There will also be minor fluctuations in length at the barbed end due to occasional rapid dissociation of strings of ADP subunits but the pointed end will be relatively stable.},

 abstract = {We review how motile cells regulate actin filament assembly at their leading edge. Activation of cell surface receptors generates signals (including activated Rho family GTPases) that converge on integrating proteins of the WASp family (WASp, N-WASP, and Scar/WAVE). WASP family proteins stimulate Arp2/3 complex to nucleate actin filaments, which grow at a fixed 70 degrees angle from the side of pre-existing actin filaments. These filaments push the membrane forward as they grow at their barbed ends. Arp2/3 complex is incorporated into the network, and new filaments are capped rapidly, so that activated Arp2/3 complex must be supplied continuously to keep the network growing. Hydrolysis of ATP bound to polymerized actin followed by phosphate dissociation marks older filaments for depolymerization by ADF/cofilins. Profilin catalyzes exchange of ADP for ATP, recycling actin back to a pool of unpolymerized monomers bound to profilin and thymosin-beta 4 that is poised for rapid elongation of new barbed ends.},

Actin filaments sustain the cell membrane and their dynamics insure cell shape changes. For example, the lamellipodium moves by actin polymerization, a mechanism that has been studied using simplified experimental systems. Much less is known about the actin cortex, a shell-like structure underneath the membrane that contracts for cell movement. We have designed an experimental system that mimicks the cell cortex by allowing actin polymerization to nucleate and assemble at the inner membrane of a liposome. Actin shell growth can be triggered inside the liposome, which offers a useful system for a controlled study. The observed actin shell thickness and estimated mesh size of the actin structure are in good agreement with cellular data. Such a system paves the way for a thorough characterization of cortical dynamics and mechanics.},

 abstract = {A fragment of the yeast formin Bni1 containing the FH1FH2 domains increases the rate of filament nucleation from pure G-actin [Pruyne et al. (2002) Science 297, 612-615]. To determine the mechanism of nucleation, we compared the G-actin dependence of Bni1FH1FH2-induced polymerization with theoretical models. The data best fit a model suggesting that Bni1FH1FH2 stabilizes an actin dimer. We also show that nucleation increases with the square root of the Bni1FH1FH2 concentration. We demonstrate that this relationship is expected for any such nucleator, independent of nucleus size. The proline-rich FH1 domain binds profilin, and deletion of this domain decreases the contribution of profilin-actin to the nucleation. A role for profilin binding to the FH1 domain in filament nucleation was supported by the inability of Bni1FH1FH2 to utilize a mutant profilin, H133S profilin, with defective binding to polyproline. Bni1FH1FH2 partially inhibits barbed-end elongation, and we find that the rate constants for both polymerization and depolymerization are decreased by approximately 50\%. Bni1FH1FH2 has no effect on pointed-end kinetics or on the critical concentration. To investigate the domains of Bni1 required for these activities, the experiments were all duplicated with the FH2 domain alone. The FH2 domain is as effective as the FH1FH2 domains together in inhibiting barbed-end kinetics; it is less effective as a nucleator but the mechanism is again best fit by dimer stabilization.},

In yeast, formins stimulate assembly of actin cables independently of Arp2/3. Here, the conserved core of formin homology domains 1 and 2 of Bni1p (Bni1pFH1FH2) was found to nucleate unbranched actin filaments in vitro. Bni1pFH2 provided the minimal region sufficient for nucleation. Unique among actin nucleators, Bni1pFH1FH2 remained associated with the growing barbed ends of filaments.

 abstract = {Actin filaments play a fundamental role in cell mechanics: assembled into networks by a large number of partners, they ensure cell integrity, deformability, and migration. Here we focus on the mechanics of the dense branched network found at the leading edge of a crawling cell. We develop a new technique based on the dipolar attraction between magnetic colloids to measure mechanical properties of branched actin gels assembled around the colloids. This technique allows us to probe a large number of gels and, through the study of different networks, to access fundamental relationships between their microscopic structure and their mechanical properties. We show that the architecture does regulate the elasticity of the network: increasing both capping and branching concentrations strongly stiffens the networks. These effects occur at protein concentrations that can be regulated by the cell. In addition, the dependence of the elastic modulus on the filaments' flexibility and on increasing internal stress has been studied. Our overall results point toward an elastic regime dominated by enthalpic rather than entropic deformations. This result strongly differs from the elasticity of diluted cross-linked actin networks and can be explained by the dense dendritic structure of lamellipodium-like networks.},

Although there are many reports of the presence of actin in the nucleus, in general they have been discounted as artifactual.

In addition, several regulators of actin polymerization are localized to the nucleus or translocate to the nucleus in a regulated manner, suggesting that there is some function of actin in the nucleus that is subject to regulation. This review discusses the evidence for actin in the nucleus and summarizes recent work suggesting that actin or actin-related proteins are involved in the regulation of nuclear processes such as chromatin remodelling.},

Global actin network size and architecture are maintained in a dynamic steady state through regulated assembly and disassembly. Here, we used experimentally defined actin structures in vitro to investigate how the activity of myosin motors depends on network architecture. Direct visualization of filaments revealed myosin-induced actin network deformation. During this reorganization, myosins selectively contracted and disassembled antiparallel actin structures, while parallel actin bundles remained unaffected. The local distribution of nucleation sites and the resulting orientation of actin filaments appeared to regulate the scalability of the contraction process. This "orientation selection" mechanism for selective contraction and disassembly suggests how the dynamics of the cellular actin cytoskeleton can be spatially controlled by actomyosin contractility.},

It would be desirable to have independent control over biochemical and mechanical cues, to analyze their relative and combined effects on stem-cell function. We developed a synthetic, interfacial hydrogel culture system, termed variable moduli interpenetrating polymer networks (vmIPNs), to assess the effects of soluble signals, adhesion ligand presentation, and material moduli from 10-10,000 Pa on adult neural stem-cell (aNSC) behavior. The aNSCs proliferated when cultured in serum-free growth media on peptide-modified vmIPNs with moduli of >/=100 Pa. In serum-free neuronal differentiation media, a peak level of the neuronal marker, beta-tubulin III, was observed on vmIPNs of 500 Pa, near the physiological stiffness of brain tissue. Furthermore, under mixed differentiation conditions with serum, softer gels ( approximately 100-500 Pa) greatly favored neurons, whereas harder gels ( approximately 1,000-10,000 Pa) promoted glial cultures. In contrast, cell spreading, self-renewal, and differentiation were inhibited on substrata with moduli of approximately 10 Pa. This work demonstrates that the mechanical and biochemical properties of an aNSC microenvironment can be tuned to regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of aNSCs.},

 abstract = {The mechanical response of giant liposomes to compression between two parallel plates is investigated in the context of an artificial actin cortex adjacent to the inner leaflet of the bilayer. We found that nonlinear membrane theory neglecting the impact of bending sufficiently describes the mechanical response of liposomes consisting of fluid lipids to compression whereas the formation of an actin cortex or the use of gel-phase lipids generally leads to substantial stiffening of the shell. Giant vesicles are gently adsorbed on glassy surfaces and are compressed with tipless cantilevers using an atomic force microscope. Force-compression curves display a nonlinear response that allows us to determine the membrane tension $\sigma$0 and the area compressibility modulus KA by computing the contour of the vesicle as a function of the compression depth. The values for KA of fluid membranes correspond well to what is known from micropipet-suction experiments and computed from monitoring membrane undulations. The presence of a thick actin shell adjacent to the inner leaflet of the liposome membrane stiffens the system considerably, as mirrored in a significantly higher apparent area compressibility modulus.},

 abstract = {An oocyte matures into an egg by extruding half of the chromosomes in a small polar body. This extremely asymmetric division enables the oocyte to retain sufficient storage material for the development of the embryo after fertilization. To divide asymmetrically, mammalian oocytes relocate the spindle from their center to the cortex. In all mammalian species analyzed so far, including human [1], mouse [2], cow [3], pig [4], and hamster [5], spindle relocation depends on filamentous actin (F-actin). However, even though spindle relocation is essential for fertility [6], the involved F-actin structures and the mechanism by which they relocate the spindle are unknown. Here we show in live mouse oocytes that spindle relocation requires a continuously reorganizing cytoplasmic actin network nucleated by Formin-2 (Fmn2). We found that the spindle poles were enriched in activated myosin and pulled on this network. Inhibition of myosin activation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) stopped pulling and spindle relocation, indicating that myosin pulling creates the force that drives spindle movement. Based on these results, we propose the first mechanistic model for asymmetric spindle positioning in mammalian oocytes and validate five of its key predictions experimentally. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Using conventional fluorophores, we have imaged single nuclear pore complexes in the nuclear membrane and aggregates of GFP-conjugated Tau protein in three dimensions. Multicolor ISM was shown on cytoskeletal-associated structural proteins and on 3D four-color images including MitoTracker and Hoechst staining. The simple adaptation of conventional CSD equipment allows superresolution investigations of a broad variety of cell biological questions.},

 abstract = {During cell locomotion and endocytosis, membrane-tethered WASP proteins stimulate actin filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex. This process generates highly branched arrays of filaments that grow toward the membrane to which they are tethered, a conflict that seemingly would restrict filament growth. Using three-color single-molecule imaging in vitro we revealed how the dynamic associations of Arp2/3 complex with mother filament and WASP are temporally coordinated with initiation of daughter filament growth. We found that WASP proteins dissociated from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex prior to new filament growth. Further, mutations that accelerated release of WASP from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex proportionally accelerated branch formation. These data suggest that while WASP promotes formation of pre-nucleation complexes, filament growth cannot occur until it is triggered by WASP release. This provides a mechanism by which membrane-bound WASP proteins can stimulate network growth without restraining it. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01008.001.},

While this syntax barrier is known to exist, whether and how it varies across programming languages has not been carefully investigated. For this article, we conducted four empirical studies on programming language syntax as part of a larger analysis into the, so called, programming language wars. We first present two surveys conducted with students on the intuitiveness of syntax, which we used to garner formative clues on what words and symbols might be easy for novices to understand. We followed up with two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java) did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords, but that languages which deviate (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did. These results, including the specifics of syntax that are particularly problematic for novices, may help teachers of introductory programming courses in choosing appropriate first languages and in helping students to overcome the challenges they face with syntax.},

 abstract = {F-actin bundles are prominent cytoskeletal structures in eukaryotes. They provide mechanical stability in stereocilia, microvilli, filopodia, stress fibers and the sperm acrosome. Bundles are typically stabilized by a wide range of specific crosslinking proteins, most of which exhibit off-rates on the order of 1s(-1). Yet F-actin bundles exhibit structural and mechanical integrity on time scales that are orders of magnitude longer. By applying large deformations to reconstituted F-actin bundles using optical tweezers, we provide direct evidence of their differential mechanical response in vitro: bundles exhibit fully reversible, elastic response on short time scales and irreversible, elasto-plastic response on time scales that are long compared to the characteristic crosslink dissociation time. Our measurements show a broad range of characteristic relaxation times for reconstituted F-actin bundles. This can be reconciled by considering that bundle relaxation behavior is also modulated by the number of filaments, crosslinking type and occupation number as well as the consideration of defects due to filament ends.},

 abstract = {Light-dependent changes in the positioning of organelles in photoreceptor cells of arthropods are a well-known phenomenon. In this study, we examine the role of the cytoskeleton in these light-dependent antagonistic movements. In dark-adapted photoreceptor cells of the locust Schistocerca gregaria, prominent sacs of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) oppose the bases of the photoreceptive microvilli. Light stimulation causes a translocation of the ER elements towards the main cell body, and an aggregation of mitochondria adjacent to the microvilli. Immunofluorescence studies and electron-microscopic examination of chemically fixed or high-pressure-frozen, freeze-substituted specimens demonstrate a lack of microtubules in the submicrovillar region. However, numerous filament bundles are aligned in close association with mitochondria and ER elements, along the track of their movement. Fluorescent phallotoxins and monoclonal anti-actin antibodies label filament bundles in the submicrovillar region, indicating that they are composed of F-actin. Finally, depolymerization of the submicrovillar actin filaments by incubation with cytochalasin B results in a blockade of the movement of mitochondria and ER cisternae towards the rhabdom. These results suggest that the light-dependent translocation of both ER cisternae and mitochondria occurs along actin filaments.},

However, there are no quantitative measurements of the mechanical properties of these actin comets. In this work, we use nanoindentation based on atomic force microscopy to measure the elastic modulus of actin comets grown on 1-$\mu$m-diameter beads in an Arp2/3 (actin-related proteins 2 and 3)-complex-dependent fashion in the absence and in the presence of VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein). Recruitment of VASP to the bead surface had no effect on the initial velocity or morphology of the comets. Instead, we observed an improved contact of the comets with the beads and an increased elastic modulus of the comets. The VASP-mediated increase in elastic modulus was dependent on both concentration and ionic strength. In conclusion, we propose that VASP plays a mechanical role in Arp2/3-complex-dependent motility by amplifying the elastic modulus of the thus assembled actin network and, consequently, by strengthening its cohesion for persistent protrusion.},

 abstract = {ING3 (inhibitor of growth family, member 3) is a subunit of the nucleosome acetyltransferase of histone 4 (NuA4) complex, which activates gene expression. ING3, which contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) motif that can bind to trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and governs transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and apoptosis via p53-mediated transcription or the Fas/caspase-8 pathway. Thus, ING3 plays a number of important roles in various somatic cells. However, the role(s) of ING3 in germ cells remains unknown. Here, we show that loss of ING3 function led to the failure of asymmetric cell division and cortical reorganization in the mouse oocyte. Immunostaining showed that in fully grown germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes, ING3 localized predominantly in the GV. After germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), ING3 homogeneously localized in the cytoplasm. In oocytes where Ing3 was targeted by siRNA microinjection, we observed symmetric cell division during mouse oocyte maturation. In those oocytes, oocyte polarization was not established due to the failure to form an actin cap or a cortical granule-free domain (CGFD), the lack of which inhibited spindle migration. These features were among the main causes of abnormal symmetric cell division. Interestingly, an analysis of the mRNA expression levels of genes related to asymmetric cell division revealed that only mTOR was downregulated, and, furthermore, that genes downstream of mTOR (e.g., Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA) were also downregulated in siIng3-injected oocytes. Therefore, ING3 may regulate asymmetric cell division through the mTOR pathway during mouse oocyte maturation.},

Although the role of mechanochemistry is well appreciated, the extent to which thick filament length regulates actomyosin contractility is unknown. Here, we study the contractility of minimal actomyosin bundles formed in vitro by mixtures of F-actin and thick filaments of nonmuscle, smooth, and skeletal muscle myosin isoforms with varied length. Diverse myosin II isoforms guide the self-organization of distinct contractile units within in vitro bundles with shortening rates similar to those of in vivo myofibrils and stress fibers. The tendency to form contractile units increases with the thick filament length, resulting in a bundle shortening rate proportional to the length of constituent myosin thick filament. We develop a model that describes our data, providing a framework in which to understand how diverse myosin II isoforms regulate the contractile behaviors of disordered actomyosin bundles found in muscle and nonmuscle cells. These experiments provide insight into physiological processes that use dynamic regulation of thick filament length, such as smooth muscle contraction.},

The pathway of branch formation is ambiguous owing to uncertainty regarding the stoichiometry and location of VCA binding sites on Arp2/3 complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the CA motif from the C terminus of fission yeast WASP (Wsp1p) bound to fission yeast and bovine Arp2/3 complex with a stoichiometry of 2 to 1 and very different affinities for the two sites (K(d)s of 0.13 and 1.6 $\mu$M for fission yeast Arp2/3 complex). Equilibrium binding, kinetic, and cross-linking experiments showed that (i) CA at high-affinity site 1 inhibited Arp2/3 complex binding to actin filaments, (ii) low-affinity site 2 had a higher affinity for CA when Arp2/3 complex was bound to actin filaments, and (iii) Arp2/3 complex had a much higher affinity for free CA than VCA cross-linked to an actin monomer. Crystal structures showed the C terminus of CA bound to the low-affinity site 2 on Arp3 of bovine Arp2/3 complex. The C helix is likely to bind to the barbed end groove of Arp3 in a position for VCA to deliver the first actin subunit to the daughter filament.},

 abstract = {Blebs are spherical membrane protrusions often observed during cell migration, cell spreading, cytokinesis, and apoptosis, both in cultured cells and in vivo. Bleb expansion is thought to be driven by the contractile actomyosin cortex, which generates hydrostatic pressure in the cytoplasm and can thus drive herniations of the plasma membrane. However, the role of cortical tension in bleb formation has not been directly tested, and despite the importance of blebbing, little is known about the mechanisms of bleb growth. In order to explore the link between cortical tension and bleb expansion, we induced bleb formation on cells with different tensions. Blebs were nucleated in a controlled manner by laser ablation of the cortex, mimicking endogenous bleb nucleation. Cortical tension was modified by treatments affecting the level of myosin activity or proteins regulating actin turnover. We show that there is a critical tension below which blebs cannot expand. Above this threshold, the maximal size of a bleb strongly depends on tension, and this dependence can be fitted with a model of the cortex as an active elastic material. Together, our observations and model allow us to relate bleb shape parameters to the underlying cellular mechanics and provide insights as to how bleb formation can be biochemically regulated during cell motility.},

 abstract = {Actin filament dynamics at the cell membrane are important for cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesions and the protrusion of the leading edge. Since actin filaments must be connected to the cell membrane to exert forces but must also detach from the membrane to allow it to move and evolve, the balance between actin filament tethering and detachment at adhesion sites and the leading edge is key for cell shape changes and motility. How this fine tuning is performed in cells remains an open question, but possible candidates are the Drosophila enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (Ena/VASP) family of proteins, which localize to dynamic actin structures in the cell. Here we study VASP-mediated actin-related proteins 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex-dependent actin dynamics using a substrate that mimics the fluid properties of the cell membrane: an oil-water interface. We show evidence that polymerization activators undergo diffusion and convection on the fluid surface, due to continual attachment and detachment to the actin network. These dynamics are enhanced in the presence of VASP, and we observe cycles of catastrophic detachment of the actin network from the surface, resulting in stop-and-go motion. These results point to a role for VASP in the modulation of filament anchoring, with implications for actin dynamics at cell adhesions and at the leading edge of the cell.},

 abstract = {Ionomycin is a Ca(2+)-selective ionophore that is widely used to increase intracellular Ca(2+) levels in cell biology laboratories. It is also occasionally used to activate eggs in the clinics practicing in vitro fertilization. However, neither the precise molecular action of ionomycin nor its secondary effects on the eggs' structure and function is well known. In this communication we have studied the effects of ionomycin on starfish oocytes and zygotes. By use of confocal microscopy, calcium imaging, as well as light and transmission electron microscopy, we have demonstrated that immature oocytes exposed to ionomycin instantly increase intracellular Ca(2+) levels and undergo structural changes in the cortex. Surprisingly, when microinjected into the cells, ionomycin produced no Ca(2+) increase. The ionomycin-induced Ca(2+) rise was followed by fast alteration of the actin cytoskeleton displaying conspicuous depolymerization at the oocyte surface and in microvilli with concomitant polymerization in the cytoplasm. In addition, cortical granules were disrupted or fused with white vesicles few minutes after the addition of ionomycin. These structural changes prevented cortical maturation of the eggs despite the normal progression of nuclear envelope breakdown. At fertilization, the ionomycin-pretreated eggs displayed reduced Ca(2+) response, no elevation of the fertilization envelope, and the lack of orderly centripetal translocation of actin fibers. These alterations led to difficulties in cell cleavage in the monospermic zygotes and eventually to a higher rate of abnormal development. In conclusion, ionomycin has various deleterious impacts on egg activation and the subsequent embryonic development in starfish. Although direct comparison is difficult to make between our findings and the use of the ionophore in the in vitro fertilization clinics, our results call for more defining investigations on the issue of a potential risk in artificial egg activation.},

@article{Vermeulen2006,
 abstract = {Displacements of optically trapped particles are often recorded using back-focal-plane interferometry. In order to calibrate the detector signals to displacements of the trapped object, several approaches are available. One often relies either on scanning a fixed bead across the waist of the laser beam or on analyzing the power spectrum of movements of the trapped bead. Here, we introduce an alternative method to perform this calibration. The method consists of very rapidly scanning the laser beam across the solvent-immersed, trapped bead using acousto-optic deflectors while recording the detector signals. It does not require any knowledge of solvent viscosity and bead diameter, and works in all types of samples, viscous or viscoelastic. Moreover, it is performed with the same bead as that used in the actual experiment. This represents marked advantages over established methods.},

@article{VonDassow1994,
 abstract = {We show here using time-lapse video tapes that cytoplasmic streaming causes nuclear migration along the anterior-posterior axis (axial expansion) in the early syncytial embryo of Drosophila melanogaster. Using confocal microscopy and labeled phalloidin we explore the distribution of F-actin during axial expansion. We find that a network of F-actin fibers fills the cytoplasm in the embryo. This actin network partially disassembles around the nuclei during axial expansion. Our observations of normal development, fixed embryos, and drug injection experiments indicate that disassembly of the actin network generates cytoplasmic movements. We suggest that the cell cycle regulates disassembly of the actin network, and that this process may be mediated directly or indirectly by the microtubules. The cytoplasmic movements we observe during axial expansion are very similar to fountain streaming in the pseudopod of amoebae, and by analogy with the pseudopod we propose a working hypothesis for axial expansion based on solation-contraction coupling within the actin network.},

@article{VonHansen2013a,
 abstract = {Biological materials such as the cytoskeleton are characterized by remarkable viscoelastic properties and therefore represent the subject of numerous micro- and macrorheological experimental studies. By generalizing the previously introduced dynamic convolution theory (DCT) to two dimensions, we devise a bottom-up approach for the viscoelastic properties of extended, crosslinked semiflexible polymer networks. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations serve to determine the dynamic linear self- and cross-response properties of isolated semiflexible polymers to externally applied forces and torques; these response functions are used as input to the DCT. For a given network topology, the frequency-dependent response of the network subject to a given external force/torque distribution is calculated via the DCT allowing to resolve both micro- and macrorheological properties of the networks. A mapping on continuum viscoelastic theory yields the corresponding viscoelastic bulk moduli. Special attention is drawn to the flexibility of crosslinkers, which couple angular degrees of freedom at the network nodes and which are found to sensitively affect the resulting rheological properties of the polymeric meshwork.},

@article{Wang2010,
 abstract = {A filamentous cytoskeleton largely governs the physical shape and mechanical properties of eukaryotic cells. In bacteria, proteins homologous to all three classes of eukaryotic cytoskeletal filaments have recently been discovered. These proteins are essential for the maintenance of bacterial cell shape and have been shown to guide the localization of key cell-wall-modifying enzymes. However, whether the bacterial cytoskeleton is stiff enough to affect the overall mechanical rigidity of a cell has not been probed. Here, we used an optical trap to measure the bending rigidity of live Escherichia coli cells. We find that the actin-homolog MreB contributes nearly as much to the stiffness of a cell as the peptidoglycan cell wall. By quantitatively modeling these measurements, our data indicate that the MreB is rigidly linked to the cell wall, increasing the mechanical stiffness of the overall system. These data are the first evidence that the bacterial cytoskeleton contributes to the mechanical integrity of a cell in much the same way as it does in eukaryotes.},

@article{Wigglesworth2013,
 abstract = {Coordinated regulation of oocyte and ovarian follicular development is essential for fertility. In particular, the progression of meiosis, a germ cell-specific cell division that reduces the number of chromosomes from diploid to haploid, must be arrested until just before ovulation. Follicular somatic cells are well-known to impose this arrest, which is essential for oocyte-follicle developmental synchrony. Follicular somatic cells sustain meiotic arrest via the natriuretic peptide C/natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPPC/NPR2) system, and possibly also via high levels of the purine hypoxanthine in the follicular fluid. Upon activation by the ligand NPPC, NPR2, the predominant guanylyl cyclase in follicular somatic cells, produces cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which maintains meiotic arrest after transfer to the oocyte via gap junctions. Here we report that both the NPPC/NPR2 system and hypoxanthine require the activity of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate-limiting enzyme required for the production of guanylyl metabolites and cGMP. Furthermore, oocyte-derived paracrine factors, particularly the growth differentiation factor 9-bone morphogenetic protein 15 heterodimer, promote expression of Impdh and Npr2 and elevate cGMP levels in cumulus cells. Thus, although the somatic compartment of ovarian follicles plays an essential role in the maintenance of oocyte meiotic arrest, as has been known for many years, this function of the somatic cells is surprisingly regulated by signals from the oocyte itself.},

There are theoretical reasons and supportive data to suggest that profilin might do both. Perhaps the most accurate description of profilin emphasizes its ability to augment actin-filament dynamics, both in polymerization and in depolymerization. The effect of profilin on the critical concentration of actin, its ability to depolymerize filaments at the barbed end and the formation of a ternary complex with thymosin $\beta$4 all need to be accurately represented in any attempt to determine a model for profilin function.},

Profilin is one of the most important actin-binding proteins; it regulates actin polymerization and interacts with many cytoskeletal proteins that link actin to extracellular membrane. The molecular mechanism of profilin has been extensively considered and debated in the literature for over two decades. Here we discuss several accepted hypotheses regarding the mechanism of profilin function as well as new recently emerged possibilities. Thermal noise is routine in molecular world and unsurprisingly, nature has found a way to utilize it. An increasing amount of theoretical and experimental research suggests that fluctuation-based processes play important roles in many cell events. Here we show how a fluctuation-based process of exchange diffusion is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization.},
