pourquoi en pur ATP les constantes sur les bout plus et moins ne sont pas les mÃªmes ? 


Question on actin polymerisation, 
in pollard 2003 , they give the scheme with the different constant of monomers association adp/atp on +/- end : 

Atp -> +  12
+ -> Atp 1.4

Atp -> -  1.3
- -> Atp 0.8 


which give respectively K+/K- 0.12, 0.6

Here is my question. 

Purely in presence of Apt-Actin (assuming no hydrolysis in Adp possible), you
then have a different K on + and minus end. Hence, you have a different
Critical concentration.  So for a certain concentration, you get threadmilling. 

Where does the energy come from ? 

I thought the threadmilling was only possible because ATP was hydrolysing while
in the filament hence allowing a different rate at each end. 

What am I missing ?
