Spinning Disk and Optical trap
==============================


Durring my PhD, I was involve in the building of another Optical trap setup.
...

We decided to build the setup both to be extensible and to able to combine on the same
microscope several imaging techniques, as well as the capacity tu use Optical trapping.

From the Imaging point of view, the final goal of the setup would be to be able
to acquire on the same sample, images from bright field, epifluorescence,
spinning disk and phase contrast. 

Optical trapping should provide both a strong fixed trap, as well as multiple
time shared optical trap, with force mesurement on each of thoses traps thanks
to position sensible detector on the back focal plane of the condensor.

In addition, we should be able to add a pused UV laser to make laser ablation
on living cells.

Optical trapping Requirement
----------------------------

The initial ~design~ for the optical trapping was to have at least one
non-mobile trap and one mobile trap that could be controlled  that could b used
at the same in the same plane in the observed samble.
