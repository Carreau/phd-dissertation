   This document is a draft which is updated regularly (Last updated |today|).
   Once I submit if for my doctoral degree at UC Davis, it will be done. So for
   now use at your own risk. The information may or may not be correct.
   Reviews, comments and suggestions are welcome and appreciated.

On the road to a higher degree, there are always many people who assist in the process,
from one's professors to librarians, but there are always some very special folks to thank.  
One of these is [Dr.] Lamont Hubbard.   He has been my adviser since I took his
multi-body dynamics course during the Winter of 2006.   Along the way he has 
always been there for me academically in every way.   We've become great friends
and have worked together on many projects both inside and out of our academic lives.
