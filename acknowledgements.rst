There are an unbelievable amount of people who help one along on the road to a
higher degree from yoru professors to the librarians but there are always some
special folks to thank. Mont Hubbard has been my adviser since I took his
multi-body dynamics course in the Winter of 2006. Along the way he has not only
always been there for me academically in every way, but become a great friend
and we've worked together on many projects together outside our academic lives.
