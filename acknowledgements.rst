On the road to a higher degree, there are always many people who assist in the
process, from one's professors to librarians, but there are always some very
special folks to thank. One of these is Mont Hubbard. He has been my adviser
since I took his multi-body dynamics course during the Winter of 2006.  Along
the way he has always been there for me academically in every way.  We've
become great friends and have worked together on many projects both inside and
out of our academic lives.
