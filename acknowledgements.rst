   This document is a draft which is updated regularly (Last updated |today|).
   Once I submit if for my doctoral degree at UC Davis, it will be done. So for
   now use at your own risk. The information may or may not be correct.
   Reviews, comments and suggestions are welcome and appreciated.

On the road to a higher degree, there are always many people who assist in the
process, from one's professors to librarians, but there are always some very
special folks to thank. Jonathan Eisen, a professor at Davis, pointed out once
during a talk that he thought the acknowledgement sections of papers were the
most under-utilized sections in scientific literature. I agree with him and can
only hope that I can give my gratitude to all who have helped me during my
tenure as a graduate student.

This first person I'd like to recognize is Mont Hubbard. He has been my adviser
since I took his multi-body dynamics course during the Winter of 2006. Along
the way he has always been there for me academically in every way and I'm
grateful for his dedication to working closely with his students and his
willingness to more than share his time. We've also become great friends and
have worked together on many projects both inside and out of our academic
lives. His search for Luke and my preliminary exams through a mound of trash is
a typical example of his devoted care for his students. Secondly, I owe much
to my long time lab mate and great friend Luke Peterson. We've been working on
understanding the same bicycle stuff for years now and if I didn't have him to
bounce ideas off and his deep nerdiness to keep my work in check I'm not
sure where I'd be with all this. Next, I owe my wonderful Fulbright experience
to my advisor Arend Schwab and colleague Jodi Kooijman in the Netherlands. I'd
like to thank them for giving me so many great opportunities and allowing me to
see the research world from the viewpoint of another culture. I'd also like to
thank my co-advisor Ron Hess at UC Davis who has worked closely with me these
past couple of years on the human control and identification portions of my
research. His expertise allowed us to stand on a strong foundation and get to
the solutions much more quickly than we would have on our own.

We've had several graduate student interns who have played important roles in
the project. Both Danique Fintelman and Peter de Lange were able to do their TU
Delft Master's internships with us. Danique helped up sort out our early design
ideas for data collection and Peter enlightened us about system identification,
eventually using some of the data collected here in his excellent Master's
thesis [Lange2011]_. Chris Dembia worked with us one summer, impressing us with
his excellent software work. Gilbert Gede helped with the mechanical design and
construction of the instrumented bicycle and Garry Negroni documented the
electrical system.

We also had quite a few undergrads work with us on the instrumented bicycle
designs and the physical parameter measurements: Steven Yen, Mohammed Osman,
Joe Rinek, Eric Chan, Chet Corcos, Steven Brendel, and Derek Pell all
contributed to the work herein.

The experimental work couldn't be done without many folks help: Jan Wright, Tai
Stillwater, Alvin Yu, Andrew Kickertz, Zach Sabato, Elliot Marshall, and Ziqi
Yin all helped run the experiments. I'm also grateful to the experimental
subjects for sitting through long hours on uncomfortable bicycles riding the
same line over and over again: Charlie Persson, Victor Alhm, and Luke Peterson.

Dr. Knoek van Soest allowed us to use the large treadmill at the Vrije
Univeristiet in Amsterdam and Richard Casius ran the motion capture equipment
for us. At Davis, Dr. James Jones and George Crocker graciously allowed us to
use the horse treadmill facility in off hours.

Several players in the bicycle dynamics world have come to my aid or given
great insight over the years, in particular Jim Papodopolous, Andy Ruina, Karl
Åström, and Chet Kyle. Also the folks on the `single track vehicle dynamics
email list <http://groups.google.com/group/stvdy>`_ have always been a great
help.

Both Batavus and Amped Bikes donated equipment for the projects. Both Dave
Scurti at Pacific Medical Prosthetics and Orthotics and Renee Vondelft at
Anchor Orthotics and Prosthetics helped out and donated materials for the body
harnesses.

I'd like to thank the Fulbright program. The experiences I gained through it
are invaluable and have affected my life in so many ways. Programs like these
are essential for promoting understanding among cultures and building bonds
among the countries of the world.

The UCD librarians have found virtually every obscure article that I've asked
them for. In particular, I'd like to thank Bob Heyer-Gray for all his work.

Thanks to my qualifying exam committee:

* Dr. Ron A. Hess, UC Davis (Chair)
* Dr. Fidelis O. Eke, UC Davis
* Dr. Donald L. Margolis, UC Davis
* Dr. Keith R. Williams, UC Davis
* Dr. Michael R. Hill, UC Davis

The NSF grant we received really gave us the freedom to explore this somewhat
obscure topic and I'm grateful that we have a country that supports the
sciences like it does. Their official disclaimer follows:

Foundation under Grant No. 0928339. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or
recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do

Finally, I'd like to thank my friends and family for their support over the
years. My parents, Cindy and Mark, have given me unconditional love and support
through all of my schooling and I'm grateful to have such caring parents. My
girlfriend, Yumi, has been by my side for the last two and half years where we
have both been working to finish our doctoral degrees. Her love and support
have helped kept me going through the high stress of getting all this done. She
also drew the wonderful studying bear drawing for my cover page.
