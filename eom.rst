Preface
=======

Attempting to derive the equations of motion of the Whipple bicycle model was
the trigger which solidified my graduate research topic. I attempted the
derivation for my class project in Mont Hubbard's winter 2006 multi-body
dynamics class and struggled with it well into the summer before finally
getting a mostly correct answer. After the fact, I realized much of my pain was
caused by a single missing apostrophe in my Autolev source code [#apostrophe]_.
Luckily another student in the class, Thomas Englehardt, had also derived the
equations and helped me debug by sharing his code and going over his methods.
Even then, it turned out that my original equations weren't "exactly" correct
and it wasn't until Luke Peterson joined our lab and got the bicycle dynamics
itch did I get the bugs sorted out in my derivation with his help.
Conversations and collaboration with Luke have improved the derivation
significantly and influence much of what follows. Luke has also continued to
improve the derivation with the goal of printing the first compact symbolic
result. With careful parameterization and selection of generalized speeds, the
non-linear equations may be able to be put in human readable form.

Non-linear Equations of Motion
==============================

The Whipple Model is the foundation of all the models presented in this
dissertation. This section details derivation of the non-linear equations of
motion using Kane's method [Kane1985]_. The non-linear equations of motion
are algebraically unwieldy and no one so far has publicly printed them in a
form compact enough to print on reasonably sized paper and certainly not in a
form suitable for any in-depth analytical understanding as pointed out in
[Meijaard2007]_. My methodology relies heavily on computer aided algebra to do
the bookkeeping in the derivation, so I will only describe the necessary
details to correctly derive the equations, leaving the algebra, trigonometry
and calculus to the computer. The symbolic equations of motion herein were
originally developed using Autolev [Kane2000]_, a proprietary and now defunct
software package for symbolically deriving equations of motion for multi-body
systems. I've since used the open source software `SymPy <http://sympy.org>`_
to derive the equations with the help of the included ``mechanics`` package
which was developed in our lab to provide a software package suitable for
academia with capabilities similar to Autolev [#autolev]_. The input code for
both software packages are available in the ``src/eom`` directory of the
dissertation source files.

Model Description
-----------------

The *Whipple Bicycle Model* [Whipple1899]_ is defined by this set of
assumptions:

* The model is made up of four rigid bodies: the rear frame (the main
  bicycle frame which may or may not include a rigid rider), the front frame
  (typically the fork and handlebar assembly), and two wheels.
* The bodies are connected to each other by frictionless revolute joints.
* The wheels have knife edges and contact the ground under pure rolling with no
  side-slip.
* The complete bicycle is assumed to be laterally symmetric.
* The bicycle rolls on flat ground.

[Astrom2005]_, [Limebeer2006]_, and [Meijaard2007]_ all provide excellent
overviews of the model, its history, and its features.

Unfortunately the word "model" is often ambiguous. I will attempt to be as
precise as possible with my wording. For this chapter, I consider a dynamic
model, such as the *Whipple Bicycle Model*, to be the equivalent to another
dynamic model if at least the minimal set of equations of motions are the same
(i.e. they give the same result when evaluated at a particular configuration
and state of interest). This implies that the Whipple Bicycle Model linearized
about the nominal configuration is a different model than the non-linear
*Whipple Bicycle Model*. I will try to be explicit when discussing the various
models.

I will use the following terminology and labels for the four rigid bodies, see
:ref:`Figure 2 <figBicycleGeometry>`:

Rear Frame, :math:`C`
   The main bicycle frame which may include parts or all of the rider.
Rear Wheel, :math:`D`
   The rear wheel of the bicycle.
Front Frame, :math:`E`
   The fork and handlebar assembly.
Front Wheel, :math:`F`
   The front wheel of the bicycle.

.. _parameterization:

Parameterization
----------------

The benchmark derivation of the linear Whipple model [Meijaard2007]_ about the
nominal configuration uses a set of non-minimal parameters based on typical
geometric parameters and inertia definitions with respect to the global
reference frame. The *nominal configuration* is defined as the configuration
when the steering angle is zero and the bicycle is upright with respect to
gravity and the ground plane. The parameters presented in [Meijaard2007]_ are
not necessarily the best choice of parameters, especially when looking at the
model from a non-linear perspective, as they are not the simplest set nor a
minimal set. For example, the benchmark parameters can been reduced in number
by making use of gyrostats, see [Sharp2008a]_ for an implementation. Choosing a
minimum, constant set of parameters can certainly reduce the complexity of the
resulting non-linear equations. In this derivation, I use a parameterization
with different geometry and inertial definitions to facilitate a more intuitive
non-linear derivation, but do not make use of gyrostats to reduce the number of
parameters.

.. _geometry:

Geometry
--------

The geometry of the Whipple model can be parameterized in an infinite amount of
ways. It is typical and often natural to define the geometry with respect to
the descriptions of bicycle geometry used in the bicycle fabrication industry
such as wheel diameter, head tube angle, trail and or rake, :ref:`Figure 1
<figTypicalBicycleGeometry>`. Choices of parameterizations like these create
unnecessary complications when developing the non-linear equations of motion
because they are typically defined with respect to only the nominal
configuration of the bicycle and are not constant with respect to the system
configuration.

.. _figTypicalBicycleGeometry:

.. figure:: figures/eom/typical-bicycle-geometry.*
   :align: center
   :width: 2.36in
   :target: _images/typical-bicycle-geometry.png

   The typical parameterization of the fundamental bicycle's geometry given in
   [Meijaard2007]_. The wheelbase :math:`w`, trial :math:`c`, steer axis tilt
   :math:`\lambda`, front wheel radius :math:`r_F`, and rear wheel radius
   :math:`r_R` are shown.

With that in mind and after trying various parameterizations, I settled on the
geometric formulation presented by [Psiaki1979]_ [#psiaki]_. The wheels are
described by their radius :math:`\left(r_{F,R}\geq0\right)` and the remaining
geometry is defined by three distances, all of which are configuration
invariant. The distance :math:`d_1` is the offset to the center of the rear
wheel from the steer axis and :math:`d_3` is the offset of the front wheel from
the steering axis. :math:`d_2` is then the distance between the wheel centers
as measured along the steer axis. :ref:`Figure 2 <figBicycleGeometry>` gives a
complete visual description of the bodies and the geometry.

.. _figBicycleGeometry:

.. figure:: figures/eom/bicycle-geometry.*
   :align: center
   :width: 3.75in
   :target: _images/bicycle-geometry.png

   The bicycle in the nominal configuration. The rigid bodies are the rear
   frame :math:`C`, rear wheel :math:`D`, front frame :math:`E`, and front
   wheel :math:`F`. The geometric parameters and important points are also
   shown.

Generalized Coordinates
-----------------------

The bicycle is completely configured in a Newtonian reference frame by nine
generalized coordinates: six coordinates locate and orient the rear frame in
space and three additional coordinates are needed for the three revolute joints
connecting the front frame and wheels to the rear frame. I chose the SAE
vehicle dynamics reference frame standard and all rotations are are defined as
positive right-handed which makes the configuration identical to that in
[Meijaard2007]_ [#standard]_. I define rotation matrices such that

.. math::
   :label: eqRotationDefinition

   \bar{a} = ^N\mathbf{R}^A \bar{n}

where :math:`\bar{n}` is a vector expressed in the :math:`N` frame and
:math:`\bar{a}` is the same vector expressed in the :math:`A` frame.

.. todo:: Is this the correct way to write this rotation equation? I am always
   confused about a good notation for writing the same vector expressed in
   different frames.

.. _figBicycleCoordinates:

.. figure:: figures/eom/bicycle-coordinates.*
   :width: 3.6in
   :align: center
   :target: _images/bicycle-coordinates.png

   The bicycle in a general configuration showing each of the eight generalized
   coordinates.

To configure the bicycle, I start by locating the point that follows the rear
wheel contact in the ground plane of the Newtonian reference frame, :math:`N`,
with the longitudinal and lateral coordinates :math:`q_1` and :math:`q_2`,
respectively, see :ref:`Figure 3 <figBicycleCoordinates>`. I then orient the
rear frame, :math:`C`, with respect to the Newtonian reference frame through a
body fixed 3-1-2 rotation defining the yaw angle, :math:`q_3`, the roll angle,
:math:`q_4`, and the pitch angle, :math:`q_5`. The intermediate frames yaw,
:math:`A` and roll, :math:`B`, are implicitly generated. The rotation matrix of
:math:`C` relative to :math:`N` is then

.. math::
   :label: eqNtoC

   ^N\mathbf{R}^C =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     c_3c_5 - s_3s_4s_5 & s_4s_5c_3 + s_3c_5 & -s_5c_4\\
     -s_3c_4 & c_3c_4  & s_4\\
     s_5c_3 + s_3s_4c_5 & s_3s_5 - s_4c_3c_5 & c_4c_5
   \end{bmatrix}

The rear wheel, :math:`D`, rotates with respect to the rear frame about the
:math:`\hat{c}_2` axis through :math:`q_6`.

.. math::
   :label: eqCtoD

   ^C\mathbf{R}^D =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     c_6 & 0 & -s_6\\
     0 & 1 & 0\\
     s_6 & 0 & c_6
   \end{bmatrix}

The front frame, :math:`E`, rotates with respect to the rear frame about the
:math:`\hat{c}_3` axis through the steering angle, :math:`q_7`.

.. math::
   :label: eqCtoE

   ^C\mathbf{R}^E =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     c_7 & s_7 & 0\\
     -s_7 & c_7 & 0\\
     0 & 0 & 1
   \end{bmatrix}

Finally, the front wheel, :math:`F`, rotates with respect to the front frame
through :math:`q_8` about the :math:`\hat{e}_2` axis.

.. math::
   :label: eqEtoF

   ^E\mathbf{R}^F =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     c_8 & 0 & -s_8\\
     0 & 1 & 0\\
     s_8 & 0 & c_8
   \end{bmatrix}

The first two coordinates locate the system in the Newtonian reference frame
and the remaining six coordinates orient the four rigid bodies within the
Newtonian reference frame.

The positions of the various points on the bicycle must be defined with respect
to the Newtonian reference frame. There are six primary points of interest: the
four mass centers, :math:`d_o,c_o,e_o,f_o`, and the two points fixed on the
wheels which are instantaneously in contact with the ground, :math:`d_n,f_n`
[#wheelcontact]_.

The mass center of the rear wheel, :math:`d_o`, is assumed to be at the center
of the wheel and is located by

.. math::
   :label: eqRearWheelMassCenter

   \bar{r}^{d_o/n_o} = q_1\hat{n}_1 + q_2\hat{n}_2 - r_F\hat{b}_3

The rear frame mass center, :math:`c_o`, is located by two additional
parameters

.. math::
   :label: eqFrameMassCenter

   \bar{r}^{c_o/d_o} = l_1\hat{c}_1 + l_2\hat{c}_3

For convenience, I define an additional point on the steer axis, :math:`c_e`,
such that

.. math::
   :label: eqDoToCe

   \bar{r}^{c_e/d_o} = d_1\hat{c}_1

The mass center of the front wheel, :math:`f_o`, is then located by:

.. math::
   :label: eqFrontWheelMassCenter

   \bar{r}^{f_o/c_e} =  d_2\hat{c}_3 + d_3\hat{e}_1

The front frame mass center, :math:`e_o`, is located by two more additional
parameters:

.. math::
   :label: eqForkMassCenter

   \bar{r}^{e_o/f_o} = l_3\hat{e}_1 + l_4\hat{e}_3

The location of the point on the rear wheel instantaneously in contact with the
ground in the Newtonian frame is then defined by

.. math::
   :label: eqRearWheelContact

   \bar{r}^{d_n/d_o} = r_F\hat{b}_3

The location of the front wheel contact point is less trivial. The vector from
the front wheel center to the contact point is defined as

.. math::
   :label: eqFrontWheelContact

   \bar{r}^{f_n/f_o} = r_F\left(\frac{(\hat{e}_2\times\hat{a}_3)\times\hat{e}_2}
   {||(\hat{e}_2\times\hat{a}_3)\times\hat{e}_2||}\right)

   \bar{r}^{f_n/f_o} =
   r_F(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)/(c_4^2c_5^2+(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)^2)^{1/2}\hat{e}_1 +
   r_Fc_4c_5/(c_4^2c_5^2+(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)^2)^{1/2}\hat{e}_3

Where the triple cross product divided by its magnitude represents the unit
vector pointing from the front wheel center to the point on the front wheel
instantaneously in contact with the ground. [BasuMandal2007]_ give a good
explanation and diagram. I originally thought of this vector in terms of dot
products, i.e. subtract the :math:`\hat{n}_3` component of :math:`\hat{e}_2` from
:math:`\hat{n}_3` to get a vector that points from the front wheel center to
the contact point.

.. math::
   :label: eqFrontWheelContactDot

   \bar{r}^{f_n/f_o} =
   r_F\left(\frac{\hat{a}_3 - (\hat{e}_2 \cdot\hat{a}_3)\hat{e}_2}
   {||\hat{a}_3 - (\hat{e}_2 \cdot\hat{a}_3)\hat{e}_2||}\right)

This is easily shown to be equivalent to :eq:`eqFrontWheelContact` by writing
the triple cross product as sum of dot products.

Holonomic Constraints
---------------------

Two holonomic configuration constraints, arising from the fact that both wheels
must touch the ground, complicate the model derivation. The first holonomic
equation is obviated by definition of the rear wheel center
:eq:`eqRearWheelMassCenter`. This enforces that the rear wheel contact point
cannot have an displacement in the :math:`\hat{n}_3` direction [#holonomic]_.
The second holonomic constraint is enforced by requiring the front wheel to
touch the ground plane. The constraint is characterized by a non-linear
relationship between the roll angle :math:`q_4`, steer angle :math:`q_7` and
pitch angle :math:`q_5`.

.. math::
   :label: eqHolonomicConstraint

   \bar{r}^{f_n/d_n}\cdot\hat{a}_3 =
   &d_2c_4c_5 - d_1s_5c_4 + r_Rc_4 +
   r_Fc_4^2c_5^2/(c_4^2c_5^2+(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)^2)^{0.5} -\\
   &(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)(d_3+r_F(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)/(c_4^2c_5^2+
   (s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)^2)^{0.5}) = 0

In this equation, I define pitch, :math:`q_6`, as the dependent coordinate. My
choice of pitch has to do with the fact that for "normal" bicycle
configurations, pitch is practically constant. This is not universal and it may
be smart to choose the dependent coordinate differently for other cases. The
constraint equation can actually be formulated into a quartic in the sine of
the pitch ([Psiaki1979]_, [Peterson2007]_) which does have an, albeit lengthy,
analytic solution. I do not opt for the analytical solution, so care is needed
when simulating and linearizing to properly take care of this dependent
coordinate.

Kinematical Differential Equations
----------------------------------

The choice of generalized speeds can significantly reduce the length of the
equations of motion [Mitiguy1996]_. This is beneficial for both working with
the analytical forms of the equations of motion and the efficiency in
computation. Even though this is true, I did not spend much effort in selecting
optimal generalized speeds, as the analytical form of the equations of motion
of this system would be difficult to interpret regardless of the choice and
because computational speed was of little concern. For :math:`i=1,\dotsc,8` I
simply choose the generalized speeds to be equal to the time derivatives of the
generalized coordinates

.. math::
   :label: eqGenerlizedSpeeds

   u_i = \dot{q}_i

Velocity
--------

The angular and linear velocities of each rigid body are required for computing
the partial velocities and accelerations used in Kane's method. Also, the
velocities of the points on the wheel at the ground contact points are needed
for the development of the nonholomic constraints. The angular velocity of the
rear frame, :math:`C`, in :math:`N` is

.. math::
   :label: eqOmegaCinN

   ^N\bar{\omega}^C =
   (c_5u_4-s_5c_4u_3)\hat{c}_1 +
   (u_5+s_4u_3)\hat{c}_2 +
   (s_5u_4+c_4c_5u_3)\hat{c}_3

Both the front frame and the rear wheel are connected to the bicycle frame by
simple revolute joints, so the angular velocities are simply

.. math::
   :label: eqOmegaDinC

   ^C\bar{\omega}^D = u_6 \hat{c}_2

.. math::
   :label: eqOmegaEinC

   ^C\bar{\omega}^E = u_7 \hat{c}_3

The front wheel has simple rotation relative to the fork.

.. math::
   :label: eqOmegaFinE

   ^E\bar{\omega}^F = u_8 \hat{e}_2

The angular velocity of any of the bodies can now be computed with respect to
the newtonian reference frame. For example

.. math::
   :label: eqOmegaFinN

   ^N\bar{\omega}^F = ^N\bar{\omega}^C + ^C\bar{\omega}^E + ^E\bar{\omega}^F

   ^F\bar{\omega}^N =
   &(s_7c_8u_5-s_8u_7-(s_5s_8-c_5c_7c_8)u_4-
   (s_8c_4c_5-c_8(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7))u_3)\hat{f}_1 + \\
   &(u_8+c_7u_5+(s_4c_7+s_5s_7c_4)u_3-s_7c_5u_4)\hat{f}_2 + \\
   &(c_8u_7+s_7s_8u_5+(s_5c_8+s_8c_5c_7)u_4+
   (c_4c_5c_8+s_8(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7))u_3)\hat{f}_3

Using the angular velocities and the position vectors the velocities of the
mass centers can be computed. Starting with mass center of the rear wheel

.. math::
   :label: eqDoInN

   ^N\bar{v}^{d_o} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\bar{r}^{d_o/n_o}\right)

   ^N\bar{v}^{d_o} = u_1\hat{n}_1 + u_2\hat{n}_2 -
   r_Rs_4u_3\hat{b}_1 + r_Ru_4\hat{b}_2

The remaining velocities can be computed by taking advantage of the fact that
various pairs of points are fixed on the same rigid body. The mass centers of
the rear wheel, :math:`d_o` and the rear frame, :math:`c_o`, and the steer axis
point, :math:`c_e`, all lie on the rear frame.

.. math::
   :label: eqCoInN

   ^N\bar{v}^{c_o} = ^N\bar{v}^{d_o} + ^N\bar{\omega}^C\times\bar{r}^{c_o/d_o}

   ^N\bar{\omega}^C\times\bar{r}^{c_o/d_o} =
   l_2(u_5+s_4u_3)\hat{c}_1 +
   (l_1(s_5u_4+c_4c_5u_3)-l_2(c_5u_4-s_5c_4u_3))\hat{c}_2 -
   l_1(u_5+s_4u_3)\hat{c}_3

.. math::
   :label: eqCeInN

   ^N\bar{v}^{c_e} = ^N\bar{v}^{d_o} + ^N\bar{\omega}^C\times\bar{r}^{c_e/d_o}

   ^N\bar{\omega}^C\times\bar{r}^{c_e/d_o} = d_1(s_5u_4+c_4c_5u_3)\hat{c}_2 -
   d_1(u_5+s_4u_3)\hat{c}_3

The velocity of the front wheel mass center is computed with respect to the
steer axis point as they both lie on the front frame

.. math::
   :label: eqFoInN

   ^N\bar{v}^{f_o} = ^N\bar{v}^{c_e} + ^N\bar{\omega}^E\times\bar{r}^{f_o/c_e}

   ^N\bar{\omega}^E\times\bar{r}^{f_o/c_e} =
   &-d_2(s_7c_5u_4-c_7u_5-(s_4c_7+s_5s_7c_4)u_3)\hat{e}_1 + \\
   &(d_3(u_7+s_5u_4+c_4c_5u_3)-d_2(s_7u_5+c_5c_7u_4+
   (s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)u_3))\hat{e}_2 + \\
   &d_3(s_7c_5u_4-c_7u_5-(s_4c_7+s_5s_7c_4)u_3)\hat{e}_3

Then the velocity of the front frame mass center is similarly

.. math::
   :label: eqEoInN

   ^N\bar{v}^{e_o} = ^N\bar{v}^{f_o} + ^N\bar{\omega}^E\times\bar{r}^{e_o/f_o}

   ^N\bar{\omega}^E\times\bar{r}^{e_o/f_o} =
   &-l_4(s_7c_5u_4-c_7u_5-(s_4c_7+s_5s_7c_4)u_3)\hat{e}_1 +\\
   &(l_3(u_7+s_5u_4+c_4c_5u_3)-l_4(s_7u_5+c_5c_7u_4+(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)u_3))\hat{e}_2 +\\
   &l_3(s_7c_5u_4-c_7u_5-(s_4c_7+s_5s_7c_4)u_3)\hat{e}_3

The velocity of the contact points on the wheel are needed to enforce the
no-slip condition and can be computed with respect to the rear and front wheel
centers. The rear contact point is

.. math::
   :label: eqDnInN

   ^N\bar{v}^{d_n} = ^N\bar{v}^{d_o} + ^N\bar{\omega}^D\times\bar{r}^{d_n/d_o}

   ^N\bar{\omega}^D\times\bar{r}^{d_n/d_o} = r_R(u_5+u_6+s_4u_3)\hat{b}_1 - r_Ru_4\hat{b}_2

which simplifies to

.. math::
   :label: eqSimpleDnInN

   ^N\bar{v}^{d_n} = r_R(u_5+u_6)\hat{b}_1 + u_1\hat{n}_1 + u_2\hat{n}_2

The front wheel contact velocity is

.. math::
   :label: eqFnInN

   ^N\bar{v}^{f_n} = ^N\bar{v}^{f_o} + ^N\bar{\omega}^F\times\bar{r}^{f_n/f_o}

   ^N\bar{\omega}^F\times\bar{r}^{f_n/f_o} =
   &r_F/(c_4^2c_5^2+(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)^2)^{0.5}\\
   &[ -c_4c_5(s_7c_5u_4-u_8-c_7u_5-(s_4c_7+s_5s_7c_4)u_3)\hat{e}_1 - \\
   &(c_4c_7u_4+s_7c_4c_5u_5-s_4s_5s_7u_4-(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)u_7)\hat{e}_2 + \\
   & (s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)(s_7c_5u_4-u_8-c_7u_5-(s_4c_7+
   s_5s_7c_4)u_3)\hat{e}_3 ]

Acceleration
------------

The angular acceleration of each body along with the linear acceleration of
each mass center are required to form :math:`F_r^*` in Kane's equations. The
angular acceleration of the bicycle reference frame in :math:`N` is

.. math::
   :label: alphaCinN

   ^N\bar{\alpha}^C =
   &(s_4s_5u_3u_4+c_5\dot{u}_4-s_5u_4u_5-c_4c_5u_3u_5-s_5c_4\dot{u}_3)\hat{c}_1 + \\
   &(c_4u_3u_4+\dot{u}_5+s_4\dot{u}_3)\hat{c}_2 +\\
   &(c_5u_4u_5+s_5\dot{u}_4+c_4c_5\dot{u}_3-s_4c_5u_3u_4-s_5c_4u_3u_5)\hat{c}_3

The remaing bodies' angular accelerations follow from simple rotations

.. math::
   :label: alphaDinC

   ^C\bar{\alpha}^D = \dot{u}_6\hat{c}_2

.. math::
   :label: alphaEinC

   ^C\bar{\alpha}^E = \dot{u}_7\hat{c}_3

.. math::
   :label: alphaFinE

   ^E\bar{\alpha}^F = \dot{u}_8\hat{e}_2

The linear acceleration of each mass center can then be computed. The
acceleration of the rear wheel center of mass is

.. math::
   :label: aDoInN

   ^N\bar{a}^{d_o} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(^N\bar{v}^{d_o}\right)

   ^N\bar{a}^{d_o} = \dot{u}_1\hat{n}_1 + \dot{u}_2\hat{n}_2 -
   r_Rs_4u_3^2\hat{a}_2 - r_R(2c_4u_3u_4+s_4\dot{u}_3)\hat{b}_1 +
   r_R\dot{u}_4\hat{b}_2 + r_Ru_4^2\hat{b}_3

The remaining accelerations are computed using the anagolous two point relationship
utilized for the velocities. The acceleration of the rear frame center of mass
is

.. math::
   :label: aCoinN

   ^N\bar{a}^{c_o} = ^N\bar{a}^{d_o} +

Motion Constraints
------------------

I make use of motion constraints to reduce the locally achievable configuration
space from nine to three. The first four constraints are introduced to enforce
the pure rolling, no side-slip, contact of the knife-edge wheels with the
ground plane and are non-holonomic. This sets the components of velocity of the
contact points on the wheels in the :math:`\hat{a}_1` and :math:`\hat{a}_2`
directions equal to zero, producing the following relationships

.. math::
   :label: eqNonholonomic1

   ^N\bar{v}^{d_n}\cdot\hat{a}_1 = s_3u_2 + c_3u_1 + r_R(u_5+u_6) = 0

The fifth motion constraint is used to manage the constraint on the
velocities imposed by the holonomic constraint, Equation
:eq:`eqHolonomicConstraint`. This is strictly introduced to eas numerical
integration and linearization. By differentiating the holonomic constraint
equation you arrive at an equation that is linear in the generalized speeds and
can be treated as any other motion constraint

.. math::
   :label: eqHolonomicDerivative

   \frac{d}{dt}(\bar{r}^{G_n/d_n}\cdot\hat{a}_3) =
   &r_Rs_4u_4 + d_1s_4s_5u_4 + (d_3+r_F(s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)/(c_4^2c_5^2+
   (s_4s_7-s_5c_4c_7)^2)^{0.5})\\

These five equations are linear in the eight generalized speeds. Following
convention, I chose the roll rate, :math:`u_4`, the rear wheel rate,
:math:`u_6`, and steer rate, :math:`u_7`, as my independent generalized speeds.

I now find the solution for the dependent speeds as a function of the
independent speeds by solving the linear system of equations and differentiate
the resulting equations to find the dependent :math:`\dot{u}`'s. The dependent
speeds take this form

.. math::
   :label: eqDependentSpeeds

   u_1 = f(u_4, u_6, u_7, q_3, \ldots, q_8)

   u_2 = f(u_4, u_6, u_7, q_3, \ldots, q_8)

   u_3 = f(u_4, u_6, u_7, q_4, \ldots, q_8)

   u_5 = f(u_4, u_7, q_4, \ldots, q_8)

   u_8 = f(u_4, u_6, u_7, q_4, \ldots, q_8)

At this point, the equations becomes analytically long and it is not
necessarily trivial to reduce the length of the equations from this point on.
A smarter choice of generalized speeds could certainly help, but I did not
spend any effort to search for a good set. From this point on in the
derivation, I will not show the analytical results of the equations of motion,
but will only walk through the remainder of the theory, as all of the
kinematical building blocks are in place to derive the equations with Kane's
method (or any other method). I highly recommend the use of computer aided
algebra to continue on, but the die-hard could certainly write them by hand.
You will have to either run my computer code to get the equations or write your
own.

Generalized Active Forces
-------------------------

The three equations for the non-holomonic generalized active forces,
:math:`\tilde{F}_r` can now be formed. For our four body system with three
degrees of freedom, :math:`r=4,6,7`, they take the form:

.. math::
   :label: eqTotalGeneralizedActiveForces

   \tilde{F}_r = (\tilde{F}_r)_C + (\tilde{F}_r)_D + (\tilde{F}_r)_E +
   (\tilde{F}_r)_F

   (\bar{F}_r)_X= ^N\bar{V}^{x_o}_r\cdot\bar{R}^{x_o} +
   ^N\bar{\omega}^X_r\cdot\bar{T}^X

where :math:`^N\bar{V}_r^{x_o}` is the partial velocity of the mass center with
respect to the generalized speed :math:`u_r`, :math:`\bar{R}^{x_o}` is the
resultant forces on the mass center (excluding non-contributing forces),
:math:`^N\bar{\omega}_r^X` is the partial angular velocity of the body with
respect to :math:`u_r`, and :math:`\bar{T}^X` is the resultant torques on the
body where :math:`X` is one of the four bodies. The partial velocities are
simply the partial derivative of the velocities in question with respect to the
generalized speeds and can be found systematically as usual [Kane1985]_. We
assume that the only force acting on the system is the gravitational force,
:math:`g`. The forces are

.. math::
   :label: eqContributingForces

   \bar{R}^{c_o} = m_Cg\hat{n}_3

   \bar{R}^{d_o} = m_Dg\hat{n}_3

   \bar{R}^{e_o} = m_Eg\hat{n}_3

   \bar{R}^{f_o} = m_Fg\hat{n}_3

We also assume that there are three generalized active torques acting on the
system which correspond to the three independent generalized speeds found
in :ref:`nonholonomic`.

The roll torque, :math:`T_4`, acts between the rear frame and the Newtonian
frame about :math:`\hat{a}_1`. The rear wheel torque, :math:`T_6`, acts between
the rear frame and the rear wheel about :math:`\hat{c}_2` and the steer torque,
:math:`T_7`, acts between the rear frame and the front frame about
:math:`\hat{c}_3`.

.. math::
   :label: eqContributingTorques

   \bar{T}^C = T_4\hat{a}_1-T_6\hat{c}_2-T_7\hat{c}_3

   \bar{T}^D = T_6\hat{c}_2

   \bar{T}^E = T_7\hat{c}_3

   \bar{T}^F = 0

Generalized Inertia Forces
--------------------------

The non-holonomic generalized inertia forces, :math:`\tilde{F}^*_r`, are formed
using the accelerations and the inertial properties of the bodies.

.. math::
   :label: eqTotalGeneralizedInertiaForces

   \tilde{F}^*_r = (\tilde{F}^*_r)_C + (\tilde{F}^*_r)_D + (\tilde{F}^*_r)_E +
   (\tilde{F}^*_r)_F

   (\bar{F}^*_r)_X= ^N\bar{V}^{X_o}_r\cdot\bar{R}^*_{X_o} +
   ^N\bar{\omega}^X_r\cdot\bar{T}^*_X

where :math:`^N\bar{V}_r^{x_o}` is once again the partial velocity of the mass
center with respect to the generalized speed :math:`u_r`,
:math:`\bar{R}^*_{x_o}` is the inertia force for :math:`X` in :math:`N` and is
defined as

.. math::
   :label: eqRStar

   \bar{R}^*_{x_o} = -m_X\quad^N\bar{a}^{x_o}

The mass of each rigid body is defined as a constant: :math:`m_C`, :math:`m_D`,
:math:`m_E` and :math:`m_F`.

:math:`^N\bar{\omega}_r^X` is the partial angular velocity of the body with
respect to :math:`u_r`, and :math:`\bar{T}^*_X` is the inertia torque on the
body which is defined as

.. math::
   :label: eqTStar

   \bar{T}^*_X =
   -(^N\bar{\alpha}^X\cdot I_X+^N\bar{\omega}^X\times I_X\cdot\bar{\omega}^X)

:math:`I_X` is the central inertia dyadic for the body in question which
corresponds to the following tensor definitions for the inertia of each rigid
body. The inertia tensor for each body is defined with respect to the mass
center and the body's local reference frame. The bicycle wheels are assumed to
be symmetric about both their 1-3 and 1-2 planes.

.. math::
   :label: ID

   \mathbf{I}_D =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   I_{D11} & 0 & 0\\
   0 & I_{D22} & 0\\
   0 & 0 & I_{D11}
   \end{bmatrix}

.. math::
   :label: IF

   \mathbf{I}_F =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   I_{F11} & 0 & 0\\
   0 & I_{F22} & 0\\
   0 & 0 & I_{F11}
   \end{bmatrix}

The rear frame and front frame are assumed to be symmetric about their 1-3 planes.

.. math::
   :label: IC

   \mathbf{I}_C =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   I_{C11} & 0 & I_{C13}\\
   0 & I_{C22} & 0\\
   I_{C13} & 0 & I_{C33}
   \end{bmatrix}

.. math::

   \mathbf{I}_E =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   I_{E11} & 0 & I_{E13}\\
   0 & I_{E22} & 0\\
   I_{E13} & 0 & I_{E33}
   \end{bmatrix}

Dynamical Equations of Motion
-----------------------------

Kane's equations are

.. math::

   \tilde{F}_r + \tilde{F}^*_r = 0

and are a vector function of three coupled equations which are linear in the
roll, steer and rear wheel accelerations. The linear system can be solved to
give the first order equations for :math:`\dot{u}_r`, where :math:`r=4,6,7`.
These can then be  paired with the essential kinematical differential equations
to form the complete set of dynamics equations of motion in the form.

.. math::

   \dot{u}_i=f(u_4, u_6, u_7, q_4, q_5, q_7)

   \dot{q}_j=u_j

where :math:`i=4,6,7` and :math:`j=4,5,6,7`. Keep in mind that the pitch angle,
:math:`q_5`, is in fact a dependent coordinate, :math:`q_5=f(q_4,q_7)`, that I
selected when dealing with the holonomic contraint,
:eq:`eqHolonomicConstraint`. Special attention during simulation and
linearization will have to be made to accommodate the coordinate and will be
described in the following sections.

[Astrom2005]_, [Meijaard2007]_, [BasuMandal2007]_, [Limebeer2006]_, and many
others do excellent job describing the essential nature of both the non-linear
Whipple model and various linearized models. Notable concepts include the fact
that many of the coordinates are ignorable, that is they do not show up in the
essential dynamical equations of motion. These are the location of the ground
contact point, :math:`q_1` and :math:`q_2`, the yaw angle, :math:`q_3`, and the
wheel angles, :math:`q_6` and :math:`q_8`. The model is also energy conserving,
because the contact points do no work. The model has many equilibrium points
and when linearized about the nominal configuration at various constant forward
speeds the open loop model (i.e.  inputs equal zero) can exhibit stability
within various speed regimes. The system is a non-minimum phase system and this
is clearly identified in the linear models by the right half plane zeros. I
recommend reading the previously mentioned references for a more detailed
picture of the model.

Simulation
----------

The non-linear model can be simulated with various initial conditions. In the
presented formulation all of the initial conditions can be set independently
except for the roll, steer, and pitch angles. Once two of the three are chosen,
the third must be solved for. I typically chose a steer and roll angle and then
solve the holonomic constraint equation numerically for pitch angle,
:math:`q_5`, to provide the correct initial condition. Figure :ref:`Figure 4
<figFigFour>` is an example open loop simulation of the non-linear model.

.. _figFigFour:

   :target: _images/meijaard2007-figure-four.png

   This is a reproduction of Figure 4 from [Meijaard2007]_. For these initial
   conditions the model demonstrates stability. It also shows the energy
   conserving nature of the non-linear model (i.e. the forward speed settles to
   a higher value than the initial speed as the energy used to dissipate the
   lateral motion is transferred to the forward speed). Generated by
   `src/eom/nonlinear_simulation.py`.

Non-linear Validation
---------------------

It is often very difficult to validate that two independently derived multibody
dynamical systems are equivalent. This due to mostly to the complexity of large
analytical expressions which can be derived by different methodologies. A
common method of validation is to evaluate the symbolic equations numerically
for non-trivial inputs and compare the results to high precision. These type of
numerical benchmarks are invaluable. They provide a baseline for model
comparison allowing for scientific reproducibility and error checking.

[BasuMandall2007]_ present the non-linear Whipple model derived with both the
Newton-Euler and Lagrange methods, along with a numerical benchmark. Table 1 in
their paper gives the derivatives of all the coordinates and speeds to high
precision for both of their derivations at a single state. They state that if
one can compute the values to machine precision to ~10 significant figures the
models can be concluded to be the same. The very first model I developed
in 2006 would not have held up to this test. I owe the validity of my model to
my labmate, Luke, as his persistence and interest in minute detail helped me
bring my model up to par.

The Basu-Mandal et al. derivations are based on different coordinates than I
use, but regardless of the coordinates they provide numerical values which can
be benchmarked if the correct coordinate transformations are applied
[#eqconv]_. In :ref:`Table 1 <tabNonLinValidation>` [#nonlincompare]_ I present
the values computed from my model in comparison to the values presented by
[BasuMandall2007]_. I've presented the same number of significant digits as
provided by Basu-Mandall for each variable [#sigfig]_. My model produces the
same result to at least eleven significant figures, thus I feel confident that
the derivation is correct.

Linearized Equations of Motion
==============================

The non-linear equations of motion can be linearized about various equilibrium
points. The obvious one is about the nominal configuration [Meijaard2007]_ but
there are many others associated mostly with steady turns [BasuMandal2007]_.
The equations can be linearized by computing the Taylor series expansion of the
non-linear equations of motion about the equilibrium point of interest and
disregarding the terms higher than first order. For the nominal configuration
this amounts to calculating the Jacobian of the system of equations with
respect to the coordinates, speeds and inputs to obtain the state matrix,
:math:`\mathbf{A}`, and the input matrix, :math:`\mathbf{B}`. The output,
:math:`\mathbf{C}`, and feed-forward, :math:`\mathbf{D}`,  matrices are
computed in the same fashion except with regards to the non-linear equations of
the outputs. The partial derivatives of each equation were evaluated at the
following fixed point: :math:`q_i=0` where :math:`i=4,5,7`, :math:`u_i=0` where
:math:`i=4,7`, and :math:`u_5=-v/r_R` where :math:`v` is the magnitude of the
component of velocity of the rear wheel center in the direction of travel. Care
has to be taken when linearizing as :math:`q_5` is a dependent coordinate which
still appears on the right hand side of the equations. In general, the chain
rule applies, but for the nominal configuration, the terms due to the implicit
definition of pitch equal zero. The linearization transforms the system into
four linear first order differential equations in the form

.. math::
   :label: eqStateSpace

   \begin{bmatrix}
     \dot{q_4}\\
     \dot{q_7}\\
     \dot{u_4}\\
     \dot{u_7}
   \end{bmatrix}
   = \mathbf{A}
   \begin{bmatrix}
     q_4\\
     q_7\\
     u_4\\
     u_7
   \end{bmatrix}
   + \mathbf{B}
   \begin{bmatrix}
     T_4\\
     T_7
   \end{bmatrix}

I calculate the equations symbolically to reach the same results presented in
[Meijaard2007]_, but my equations are much lengthier as the simplification
routines available for the derivatives of the full non-linear equations didn't
provide much reprise. [Meijaard2007]_ assumes linearity in their derivation
from the start of the derivation and avoids many of the simplification issues.
The accuracy of the linearized model was checked by comparing the numerical
results to the benchmark bicycle in two ways. First the linearized equations of
motion, Equation :eq:`eqStateSpace`, were rearranged into two second order
differential equations in the canonical form (Equation :eq:`eqCanonical`)
presented in [Meijaard2007]_. They present the values for the coefficient
matrices (:math:`\mathbf{M}`, :math:`\mathbf{C}_1`, :math:`\mathbf{K}_0` and
:math:`\mathbf{K}_2`) for the benchmark parameter set to at least 13
significant figures and the linearization presented here matched all of the
significant figures. [Meijaard2007]_ also provide the eigenvalues of the state
matrix at various speeds. :ref:`Table 2 <tabLinCompare>` [#lincompare]_ shows
the eigenvalues computed at 5 m/s in comparison to the values in Table 2 of
[Meijaard2007]_ where my model matches to at least 13 significant figures.

.. math::
   :label: eqCanonical

   \mathbf{M}\ddot{\bar{q}} + v\mathbf{C}_1\dot{\bar{q}} +
   \left[ g \mathbf{K}_0 + v^2 \mathbf{K}_2 \right] \bar{q} = 0

   \bar{q} = [\phi \quad \delta]^T = [q_4 \quad q_7]^T

The lateral dynamics of this linear model behaves remarkebly similar to the
non-linear model especially around the regime of typical a typical bicycle's
operating point. :ref:`Figure 5 <figLinSim>` gives an example simulation with
the same initial conditions as the  :ref:`Figure 4 <figFigFour>`. Notice that
the lateral dynamics, steer and roll, are almost identical, but that the
constant forward speed equilibrium condition removes the consertative nature
demonstrated in the non-linear model.

It turns out that speed has profound effect on the lateral dynamics of the
bicycle. It is useful to plot the root locus, :ref:`Figure 6 <figRootLocus>`,
of the characeteristic equation with respect to the change in the equilibrium
forward speed to visualize the time constants, damping, frequency, and
stability of each of the modes of motion. The modes of motion can be clearly
identified along with the speed depedent stability.

.. _figRootLocus:

   :width: 5in

   :target: _images/root-locus-complex.png

   The root locus with respect to forward speed. The color variation signifies
   speed as shown in the right side color bar. Two of the eigenvalues are real,
   one being stable but increasingly fast and the other slows to a marginally
   unstable location at high speed. The other two are initially real and
   unstable, but they coalesce into a complex pair and eventually become
   stable, at a higher moderately well damped frequency. Generated by
   `src/eom/linear_comparison.py`.

Another useful and popular way to visualize the root locus is by plotting the
real and imaginary eigenvalue components separately versus forward speed,
:ref:`Figure 7<figEigenvalues>`. This view gives a more clear view of the
stable speed range.

.. _figEigenvalues:

.. figure:: figures/eom/root-locus.*
   :width: 5in
   :align: center
   :target: _images/root-locus.png

   The real (solid) and imaginary (dashed) eigenvalue components versus speed
   for an example parameter set. The four modes of motion are identified.
   *Caster* is stable and real for all positive values of speed. It describes
   the tendency for the front wheel to right itself in forward motion.
   *Capsize* is always real, stable at low speeds and becomes marginally
   unstable at a higher speed. It describes the roll of the rear frame. *Weave*
   is real at very low speeds and describes an inverted pendulum-like motion
   i.e. the bicycle falls over. As speed increases the eigenvalues coalesce
   into a complex conjugate pair that describes a sinusoidal motion of the roll
   and steer, with steer lagging the roll. This mode becomes stable at a higher
   speed. The weave and capsize critical speeds bound a stable speed range.
   Generated by `src/eom/linear_comparison.py`.

The behavior of the modes of motion can be visualized by plotting the
eigenvector components in the imaginary plane for various speeds. Within the
speed range shown in the root locus plots, there are four distinct speed ranges
of interest: below the weave bifurcation, in between the weave bifurcation and
the weave critical speed, the stable speed range, and above the capsize
critical speed. At a forward speed of 0.5 m/s, all of the eigenvalues are real,
with two unstable and two stable. In :ref:`Figure 8<figEVecHalf>`, notice that
the unstable eigenvalue values predict two modes where the roll and steer
states exponentially increase and with the roll and steer 180 degrees out of
phase. These modes describes a simple unstable inverted pendulum motion.

   each mode at 5.0 m/s. Only the roll angle, :math:`q_4`, and steer angle,

   ``src/eom/plot_eigenvectors.py``.

For speeds above the weave bifurcation speed, this linear model exhibits three
distinct modes of motion, which have been named weave, capsize, and caster.
Once the bicycle is brought up to a speed of 3 m/s the two unstable eigenvalues
coalesce into a complex pair. :ref:`Figure 9<figEVecHalf>` The left most graph
depicts the caster mode which is simply shows a rapidly decaying steer angle.
The unstable weave mode eigenvector components show that the steer amplitude is
about 25% larger than the roll amplitude and roll angle leads the steer angle
by about 50 degrees. Finally, the capsize mode is a decays in roll and steer,
with the roll at about twice the amplitude as steer.

   :math:`q_7`, components are shown. Generated by
   ``src/eom/plot_eigenvectors.py``

At 5 m/s all modes are stable with the weave mode showing that the roll now
only leads the steer by about 10 degrees. The caster and capsize are similar to
3 m/s.

   ``src/eom/plot_eigenvectors.py``

Finally, at 7 m/s the capsize mode goes unstable, with a slow decay primarily
in roll.

   ``src/eom/plot_eigenvectors.py``

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe the complete motion of the linear
bicycle model where the motion from each mode is sum to gather the whole motion
at a given speed. Most normal bicycles exhibit this basic behavior.

Parameter Conversion
====================

This section details the conversion from the benchmark parameter set in
[Meijaard2007]_ to my parameter set. When the bicycle is in the nominal
configuration the parameters can be converted with the following relationships.

Starting with the geometry, the wheel radii are defined the same, but the
remaining geometry is calculated as

.. math::
   :label: eqGeometryConversion

   d_1 = \operatorname{cos}(\lambda) (c + w - r_R \operatorname{tan}(\lambda))

   d_3 = -\operatorname{cos}(\lambda) (c - r_F \operatorname{tan}(\lambda))

   d_2 = \frac{(r_R + d_1 \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) - r_F + d_3
   \operatorname{sin}(\lambda))}{\operatorname{cos}(\lambda)}

The mass center locations are

.. math::
   :label: eqMassCenterConversion

   l_1 = x_B  \operatorname{cos}(\lambda) - z_B  \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) -
   r_R  \operatorname{sin}(\lambda)

   l_2 = x_B  \operatorname{sin}(\lambda) + z_B  \operatorname{cos}(\lambda) +
   r_R \operatorname{cos}(\lambda)

   l_4 = (z_H + r_F)  \operatorname{cos}(\lambda) + (x_H - w)
   \operatorname{sin}(\lambda)

   l_3 = \frac{x_H - w - l_4  \operatorname{sin}(\lambda)}
   {\operatorname{cos}(\lambda)}

The masses are equivalently defined. Here the left side gives my variables and
the right gives the benchmark variables.

.. math::
   :label: eqMassConversion

   m_C = m_B

   m_D = m_R

   m_E = m_H

   m_F = m_F

The moments of inertia of the wheels are also equivalently defined.

.. math::
   :label: eqWheelInertiaConversion

     \mathbf{I}_D =
     \begin{bmatrix}
       I_{D11} & 0 & 0\\
       0 & I_{D22} & 0\\
       0 & 0 & I_{D11}
     \end{bmatrix}
     = \mathbf{I}_R =
     \begin{bmatrix}
       I_{Rxx} & 0 & 0\\
       0 & I_{Ryy} & 0\\
       0 & 0 & I_{Rxx}
     \end{bmatrix}

     \mathbf{I}_F =
     \begin{bmatrix}
       I_{F11} & 0 & 0\\
       0 & I_{F22} & 0\\
       0 & 0 & I_{F11}
     \end{bmatrix}
     = \mathbf{I}_F =
     \begin{bmatrix}
       I_{Fxx} & 0 & 0\\
       0 & I_{Fyy} & 0\\
       0 & 0 & I_{Fxx}
     \end{bmatrix}

The moments and products of inertia for the frame and fork require the
direction cosine matrix with respect to rotation through the steer axis tilt,
:math:`\lambda`.

.. math::
   :label: eqConversionRotation

   \mathbf{R} =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     c_\lambda & 0. & -s_\lambda\\
     0. & 1. & 0.\\
     s_\lambda & 0. & c_\lambda
   \end{bmatrix}

.. math::
   :label: eqFrameInertiaConversion

    \mathbf{I}_B =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      I_{Bxx} & 0 & I_{Bxz}\\
      0 & I_{Byy} & 0\\
      I_{Bxz} & 0 & I_{Bzz}
    \end{bmatrix}

    \mathbf{I}_C =  \mathbf{R} \mathbf{I}_B \mathbf{R}^T

.. math::
   :label: eqForkInertiaConversion

   \mathbf{I}_H =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     I_{Hxx} & 0 & I_{Hxz}\\
     0 & I_{Hyy} & 0\\
     I_{Hxz} & 0 & I_{Hzz}
   \end{bmatrix}

   \mathbf{I}_E =  \mathbf{R} \mathbf{I}_H \mathbf{R}^T
