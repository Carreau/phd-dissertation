Bicycle Equations Of Motion
===========================

Introduction
============

As was mentioned in the introduction, the bicycle has been studied by many
scientists over the years. The bicycle is a rich dynamic system that is
difficult to model accurately.  [Meijaard2007]_ did an excellent job of sorting
through 140 years of bicycle dynamics papers and providing a benchmarked
bicycle that finally verified the correct equations of the linearized Whipple
ModelÂ [Whipple1899]_. Bicycle-only models can be divided into two main
categories: models that do not exhibit open loop stability and models that do.
All of these models can be extended by adding additional dynamics such as
tire-road interactions, frame flexibility, and human biomechanics. These
extensions can have effects on the stability and control of the bicycle.

Simple Models
-------------

Typically a one degree of freedom model that produces a roll equation of motion
is used to model a bicycle in its most basic form. This model has been derived
and analyzed by many including, but not limited to, [Timoshenko1948]_,
[Karnopp2004]_ and [Astrom2005]_. These models do not have enough fidelity to
predict a real bicycle's uncontrolled motion and do not predict the speed
dependent stability that higher order models can. These models have been used
for control studies [Getz1994,CloydHubbardAlaways1996,Karnopp2004]_ as they
exhibit the non-minimum phase behavior that predicts the necessity of steering
into the roll for stabilization. Controllers based on these models have also
been used on actual experimental control models [Suryanarayanan2002]_. This
type of model will not be used in my studies.

Whipple Model
-------------

The lowest order model that has had some experimental validation
[Kooijman2008]_, is able to predict speed dependent stability and includes a
complete physical description of the four rigid bodies is typically referred to
as the "Whipple Model". This is in honor of Francis J.  W. Whipple, the first
author to publish a correct derivation of the linear equations of motion of
this particular bicycle model [Whipple1899]_.  This model will be used as a
basis for all further studies proposed herein. Many researchers over the past
century have attempted to derive and analyze this model but very few have been
successful. [Meijaard2007]_ give a complete historical review of uncontrolled
bicycle research which made use of the historical comparisons in the thesis by
[Hand1988]_. [Meijaard2007]_ also benchmarked the Whipple Model by deriving the
linearized equations of motion by four independent methods (two independent pen
and paper calculations and two different dynamic software packages).
Furthermore, [Basu-Mandal2007]_ benchmarked various torque free circular
motions in the non-linear case with two additional independent derivations of
the equations of motion. [Kooijman2006]_ has verified by experiment that the
linearized Whipple Model does in fact predict the uncontrolled motion of a
normal bicycle in a speed range of about 3 to 6 m/s.  These papers and my own
derivation of the Whipple Model are the basis for using this model in my
research.

Motorcycle Models
-----------------

The motorcycle is modeled in much the same fashion as the bicycle except that
tire-road interactions and suspension are included.  Also, the human's
biomechanical motions play a smaller role because the motorcycle typically
weighs more than the rider. The most cited models are those developed by Robin
S. Sharp. His first model [Sharp1971]_ includes tire compliance and side slip.
The model has been refined over the years to improve accuracy by adding frame
flexibility, rider models and improving the tire models
[SharpLimebeerGani1999,SharpLimebeer2001,SharpEvangelouLimebeer2004]_.  He was
also the first to give names to the eigenmodes of the Whipple Model
[Sharp1975]_. He and David Limebeer give a review of bicycle and motorcycle
modeling in [LimebeerSharp2006]_ covering much of their work. Other notable
studies include ones developed by [Koenen1983]_ and [CossalterLot2002]_.

Whipple Model
=============

Attempting to derive the equations of motion of the Whipple model is pretty
much what got me hooked into bicycle dynamics. I attempted it for my class
project in Mont Hubbard's winter 2006 multi-body dynamics class and struggle
with it well into the summer before finally getting a mostly correct answer.
After the fact, I realized much of my pain was cause by a single missing
apostrophe in my Autolev computer code[#]_. Another student, Thomas Englehardt,
in the class also derived the equations and helped me debug by sharing his code
and going over his methods. It turned out that my orignial equations weren't
"exactly" correct and it wasn't until Luke Peterson joined our lab and got the
bicycle dynamics itch did I get the bugs sorted out in my derivation.
Conversations and collaboration with Luke have improved the derivation
significantly and influence much of what follows. Luke has also continued to
improve the derivation with the goal of printing the first compact symbolic
result.

Derivation of the Non-linear Equations of Motion
------------------------------------------------

The Whipple Model will be the foundation for any extensions we develop. This
section details derivation of the non-linear equatios of motion using Kane's
method [KaneLevinson1985]_. The equations of motion are algrebracally unwieldy
and no one so far has publicly shown them in a form compact enough to print for
analytical understanding[#]_. My methodology relies heavily on computer aided
algebra to do the bookkeeping in the deviration, so I will only describe the
necessary details to derive the equations, leaving the algebra and derivatives
to the computer. The symbolic equations of motion herin were developed within
the frame work of Autolev.

Model
~~~~~

My definition of the Whipple Bicycle Model includes these requirements:

* The Whipple model is made up of four rigid bodies (frame/rider,
  fork/handlebar and two wheels)
* The bodies are connected to each other by frictionless revolute joints.
* The wheels contact the ground under pure rolling and no sideslip conditions.
* The bicycle is assumed to be laterally symmetric.
* Flat ground.

   steer configuration. The rigid bodies are the rear wheel, C, frame/rider, D,
   fork/handlebar, F and front wheel, G. The geometric parameters are also
   shown.

Geometry
~~~~~~~~

The geometry of the whipple model can be parameterized in an infinite amount of
ways. It is typical and natural to define the geometry with respect to the modern
descriptions of bicycle geometry that is used in the bicyle fabrication world,
such as wheel diameter/radius, head tube angle, trail and or rake. These
parameterizations pose a problem when developing the non-linear equations of
motion because they are typically defined with respect to a nominal
configuration of the bicycle. The benchmark derivation of the linear whipple
model about the nominal configuration uses a set of non-minimal parameters to
to parameterize the model. These are a bad choice of parameters when looking at
the model from a non-linear perspective, as they vary with time. These
parameters have also been minimized by [Sharp2008]_ by making use of gyrostats.
This formulation helps to simplify the model, but also does not simplify the
non-linear formulation. The motorcycle treatement of geometry is a good
reference [xxxx]_.

With that in mind after using various parameterizations, Luke and I have
settled on the geometric formulation presented by [Psiaki]_. The wheels are
described by their radius (> = 0) and the remaining geometry is defined by
three distances which are time invariant. The distance :math:`d_1` is the
offset to the center of the rear wheel from the steer axis and :math:`d_3` is
the offset of the front wheel from the steering axis. :math:`d_2` is then the
distance along the steer axis from the point of perpendicular intersection to
the rear and front offset lines.

Generalized Coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I use eight generalized coordinates to develop the bicycle configuration. This
is not the miminal set in terms of holonomic constraints or in terms of
ignorable coordinates, but is useful none-the-less primarily due to the nature of
deriving the equations with a CAS.

Before time, there first was the Newtonian reference frame. We chose the
coordiates to fit the ____ standard as in [Meijaard2007]_. I start with
locating the rear wheel contact point in the ground plane of the Newtonian
reference frame, :math:`N`, longitudinal and lateral coordinates :math:`q_1`
and :math:`q_2`, which turn out to be ignorable coordinates. I then orient the
bicycle rear frame reference frame, :math:`C`, with respect to the newtonian
reference frame through a body fixed 3-1-2 rotation defining the yaw angle,
:math:`q_3`, the roll angle, :math:`q_4`, and the pitch angle, :math:`q_5`. The
intermediate frames yaw, :math:`A` and roll, :math:`B`, are implicitly
generated along the way. The rotation matrix of :math:`C` relative to :math:`N`
is then:

.. math::
   :label: NtoC

   ^NR^C =
   \left[
   \begin{array}{c}
   -s_3s_4s_5 + c_5c_3 & -s_3c_4 & s_3s_4c_5 + s_5c_3\\
   c_3s_4s_5 + c5s_3 & c_3c_4 & -c_3s_4c_5 + s_5s_4\\
   -c_4s_5 & s_4 & c_4c_5
   \end{array}
   \right]

The rear wheel reference frame, :math:`D`, rotates with repect to the bicycle
frame about the :math:`\hat{c}_2` axis through :math:`q_6`.

.. math::
   :label: CtoD

   ^CR^D =
   \left[
   \begin{array}{c}
   c_6 & 0 & -s_6\\
   0 & 1 & 0\\
   s_6 & 0 & c_6
   \end{array}
   \right]

The fork/handlebar reference frame, :math:`E`, rotates with respect to the
bicycle reference frame about the :math:`\hat{c}_3` axis through :math:`q_7`.

.. math::
   :label: CtoE

   ^CR^E =
   \begin{array}{c}
   c_7 & s_7 & 0\\
   -s_7 & c_7 & 0\\
   0 & 0 & 1
   \end{array}

Finally, the front wheel, :math:`F`, rotates with respect to the fork/handlebar
through
:math:`q_8` about the :math:`\hat{e}_2` axis.

.. math::
   :label: EtoF

   ^ER^F =
   \begin{array}{c}
   c_8 & 0 & -s_8\\
   0 & 1 & 0\\
   s_8 & 0 & c_8
   \end{array}

The first two coordinates locate the the system in the Newtownian reference
frame and the remaing six coordinates orient the four rigid bodies within the
Newtonian reference frame.

Position
~~~~~~~~

The positions of the various points on the bicycle must be defined with respect
to the Newtonian reference frame. There are six primary points of interest: the
four mass centers and the two ground contact points.

The point of contact for the bicyle wheels are one of techincally abstract
points in dynamics. There are four distinct points of concern. The first being
the point in the ground plane that instanteously contacts the wheel at any
given time, the point in the ground plane that tracks the contact point, the
point on the wheel that instataneously contacts the ground at any given time,
and the point on the wheel ...

.. todo::
   Contact points need better explanations.

The location of the contact point in the newtonian frame is defined by:

.. math::
   :label: rearWheelContact

   \bar{r}^{D_n/N_o} = q_1\hat{n}_1 + q_2\hat{n}_2

This encompasses a holonomic constraint (the contact point can't move in the n3
direction.

The mass center of the rear wheel, :math:`D_o`, is assumed to be at the center of the wheel:

.. math::
   :label: rearWheelMassCenter

   \bar{r}^{D_o/D_n} = -r_F\hat{b}_3

The mass center of the front wheel, :math:`F_o`, is located by the frame and
fork dimensions:

.. math::
   :label: frontWheelMassCenter

   \bar{r}^{F_o/D_o} = d_1\hat{c}_1 + d_2\hat{c}_3 + d_3\hat{e}_1

The bicycle frame mass center, :math:`C_o`, is located by two additional
parameters:

.. math::
   :label: frameMassCenter

   \bar{r}^{C_o/D_o} = l_1\hat{c}_1 + l_2\hat{c}_3

Similarly the fork mass center, :math:`E_o`, is located by two more additional
parameters.

.. math::
   :label: forkMassCenter

   \bar{r}^{E_o/F_o} = l_3\hat{e}_1 + l_4\hat{e}_3

The location of the front wheel contact point is less trivial. The vector from
the front wheel center to the contact point is defined as:

.. math::
   :label: frontWheelContact

   \bar{r}^{F_n/F_o} = r_F(\hat{e}_2\times\hat{n}_3)\times\hat{e}_2

Where the triple cross product represents the unit vector pointing from the
front wheel center to the front wheel contact. [Basu-Mandal2007]_ give an
explanation and diagram. The equation can also be though of in terms of dot
products:

.. math::
   :label: frontWheelContactDot

   \bar{r}^{F_n/F_o} = -r_F\hat{e}_2(\hat{e}_2\cdot\hat{n}_3)

.. todo::
   Check this equation.

Holonomic Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A holonomic configuration constraint, arising from the fact that
both wheels must touch the ground, complicates the model
derivation. The constraint (Eq. eq:wheelsTouch) is characterized by
a nonlinear relationship between the lean angle :math:`q_4`,
steer angle :math:`q_7` and pitch angle :math:`q_6`. Pitch,
:math:`q_6`, is taken as the dependent coordinate and the
constraint equation can be formulated into a quartic in the sine of
the pitch [Psiaki1979]_, [Peterson2007]_. To avoid having to
solve the quartic algebraically, the derivative of the constraint
equation is taken.

This produces a velocity constraint equation that is linear in the
derivatives of the pitch angle, steer angle and lean angle
(Eq.Â eq:pitchVelCon) where :math:`a`, :math:`b` and :math:`c`
are functions of the coordinates and geometric parameters. This
allows an explicit solution for the pitch angular velocity
:math:`u_6`, making it a dependent generalized speed.

.. math::
   \bar{\mathbf{r}}^{G_n/C_n}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_3=f\left(q_4,q_6,q_7\right)=0
   :label: eq:wheelsTouch

.. math::
   \frac{d}{dt}_\left(\bar{\mathbf{r}}^{G_n/C_n}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_3\right)=a\cdot u_4+b\cdot u_5+c\cdot u_7=0
   :label: {eq:pitchVelCon}

Non-holonomic Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Four nonholomic constraints (Eq.eq:noSlip) further reduce the
locally achievable configuration space to three degrees of freedom.
The pure rolling, no side-slip, contact of the knife-edge wheels
with the ground plane requires that there are no components of
velocity of the wheel contact points in the
:math:`{\mathbf{n}}_1` and :math:`{\mathbf{n}}_2` directions.

.. math::
   ^N\bar{\mathbf{v}}^{C_n}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1=
   ^N\bar{\mathbf{v}}^{C_n}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_2=
   ^N\bar{\mathbf{v}}^{G_n}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1=
   ^N\bar{\mathbf{v}}^{G_n}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_2=0
   :label: {eq:noSlip}

Eight generalized coordinates, one of which is dependent, and three
independent generalized speeds (:math:`u_i=\dot{q}_i` where
:math:`i = 4,5,7`) describe the system. Five of these are
ignorable coordinates (:math:`q_i`, :math:`i = 1,2,3,5,8`),
that is they do not occur in the dynamical equations of motion. The
nonminimal set of dynamic equations of motion (Eqs.Â eq:accels
andÂ eq:speeds) were formed by Kane's method. They are nonminimal
because pitch angle, :math:`q_6`, was not solved for explicitly.
With this set of equations one must calculate the pitch angle
numerically for its initial condition when simulating and for the
fixed point when linearizing.

.. math::
   \dot{u}_i=f\left(u_4,u_5,u_7,q_4,q_6,q_7\right)\textrm{ where }i=4,5,7
   :label: {eq:accels}

.. math::
   \dot{q}_i=u_i\textrm{ where }i=4,5,6,7
   :label: {eq:speeds}

The equations of motion can then be linearized by calculating the
Jacobian of the system of equations. The partial derivatives were
evaluated at the following fixed point: :math:`q_i=0` where
:math:`i=4,6,7`, :math:`u_i=0` where :math:`i=4,7`, and
:math:`u_5=-v/R_r` where :math:`v` is the constant forward
speed of the bicycle. This reduces the system to four linear first
order differential equations in the form:

.. math::
   \frac{d}{dt}
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
        q_4\\q_5\\q_6\\q_7\\u_4\\u_5\\u_7
    \end{array}
    \right]
    =
    \mathbf{A}
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
        q_4\\q_5\\q_6\\q_7\\u_4\\u_5\\u_7
    \end{array}
    \right]
    \label{eq:linearEq}

Validation
----------

The linearized model was checked for accuracy against
the benchmark bicycle in two ways. First the linearized equations
of motion (Eq.Â eq:linearEq) were formulated into two second order
differential equations in the more familiar canonical form
(Eq.Â eq:canonical) used inÂ [MeijaardPapadopoulosRuinaSchwab2007]_.
They present the values for the coefficient matrices
(:math:`\mathbf{M}`, :math:`\mathbf{C}_1`,
:math:`\mathbf{K}_0` and :math:`\mathbf{K}_2`) for the
benchmark parameter set at least 15 significant figures and my
model matched all of the significant figures.

.. math::
   \mathbf{M\dot{u}}+v\mathbf{C}_1\mathbf{u}+\left[g\mathbf{K}_0+v^2\mathbf{K}_2\right]\mathbf{q}=0
   :label: {eq:canonical}

The eigenvalues of the system of linear equations can be calculated
and are typically plotted versus forward speed for the linear
upright constant speed configuration (Fig.Â fig:eigenvalues).
[MeijaardPapadopoulosRuinaSchwab2007]_also provided eigenvalue
calculations at various speeds of the benchmark bicycle for model
comparison. The eigenvalues for my model matched to at least 15
significant figures.

.. todo::
   Eigenvalues versus speed for an example bicycle. The four modes of
   motion are identified. \\emph[Caster]_ is stable and real for all positive
   values of speed. It describes the tendency for the front wheel to right
   itself in forward motion. \\emph[Capsize]_ is always real, stable at low speeds
   and becomes marginally unstable at a higher speed. It describes the roll of
   the rear frame. \\emph[Weave]_ is real at very low speeds and describes an
   inverted pendulum-like motion i.e. the bicycle falls over. As speed increases
   the eigenvalues coalesce into a complex conjugate pair that describes a
   sinusoidal motion of the roll and steer, with steer lagging the roll. This
   mode becomes stable at a higher speed. The weave and capsize critical speeds
   bound a stable speed range.
